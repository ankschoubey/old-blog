<p>There are two parts to communication: listening and speaking. And these roles change between the two.</p>

<p>In any communication any form, there is a some amount of context loss. But in some communication context loss is much higher.</p>

<p>This is because of the way sentences are phrased. Or how is someone is nervous communicating. Or what pre-assumptions someone has made which could and could not be due to lack of information.</p>

<p>This could be us. Or this could be the other person.</p>

<p>We canâ€™t control how the other person understands. Not fully at-least. But we could try to present ourselves in a way that the other person feels more open to talk, express and communicate.</p>

<p>By choosing the right medium, listening better and articulating properly; one can reach close to 100% retention of information.</p>

<p>This would help us reach an understanding faster. The best way to do it is to keep things light and to be calm.</p>

<h1 id="choose-the-right-medium">
<a class="anchor" href="#choose-the-right-medium" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Choose the right medium</h1>

<p>The tone of voice, facial expressions, body language, etc provide useful information even if they arenâ€™t studied explicitly. Itâ€™s what our social brains are adapt to do.</p>

<p>Therefore, cutting these features out of communication can be problematic in certain cases.</p>

<p>Texting: Should not be used for emotional communication no matter how hard it feels. If itâ€™s becoming hard, transition:Logistics 
Calls: Normal. Emotional. 
Video: Better
In Person: Best. Aim for in-person communication.</p>

<h1 id="listening">
<a class="anchor" href="#listening" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Listening</h1>

<p>Remember, the goal is to seek to understand, than to be understood.</p>

<h2 id="have-the-attitude-of-the-person-you-are-listening-to-is-important-and-worth-listening-to">
<a class="anchor" href="#have-the-attitude-of-the-person-you-are-listening-to-is-important-and-worth-listening-to" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Have the attitude of: The person you are listening to is important and worth listening to.</h2>

<p>Having mutual respect leads to better understanding and less drama.</p>

<h2 id="listen-carefully-and-listen-everything">
<a class="anchor" href="#listen-carefully-and-listen-everything" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Listen carefully and listen everything.</h2>

<p>No matter how silly on mundane something seems. It maybe of value to the other person. Donâ€™t negate anything by saying itâ€™s dumb. It may or maynot be dumb. Listen and ask followup questions.</p>

<h2 id="understand-the-problem-instead-of-giving-solution">
<a class="anchor" href="#understand-the-problem-instead-of-giving-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Understand the problem instead of giving solution</h2>

<p>Often we try to suggest a solution to something thatâ€™s not even a problem. Itâ€™s like Hammer ðŸ”¨. Wack. And nothing works. Because it wasnâ€™t supposed to.</p>

<p>Life is complex and their are nuances. Those nuances need to be understood.</p>

<p>Learn to emphathize.</p>

<p><img src="/images/team-work/empathy.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>In any case of communication, we canâ€™t be hundred precent certain or 0% certain. Therefore we have to range ourselves between 95% certain and 5% certain.</p>

<h2 id="calm-the-other-person">
<a class="anchor" href="#calm-the-other-person" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Calm the other person</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it may happen that the person you are talking to has intense emotions.</p>

<p>This could be anger, happiness, sadness. Or they might be too critical of themselves (Like someone you are reading ðŸ˜‡). In someway they have their guards up.</p>

<p>Step 1. Calm them down.</p>

<p>Make them drink water.</p>

<p>Tell them to calm down. And that way you can understand them a bit better.</p>

<h2 id="do-not-interrupt">
<a class="anchor" href="#do-not-interrupt" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Do not interrupt</h2>

<p>Rather than interrupting, wait for when the person has stopped. Even if they are are saying something that you donâ€™t agree with. Let them speak completely. This not only helps understand the other person better, this is more respectful.</p>

<h2 id="dont-present-your-arguments-early-on">
<a class="anchor" href="#dont-present-your-arguments-early-on" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Donâ€™t present your arguments early on.</h2>

<p>This makes someone jump to a different tangium. Your goal is to understand their points.</p>

<p>Let the person present his points.</p>

<h2 id="dont-wait-for-your-turn">
<a class="anchor" href="#dont-wait-for-your-turn" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Donâ€™t wait for your turn</h2>

<p>Donâ€™t wait for your turn to speak. When the person has stopped speaking, you could take a moment to think and then speak or ask followup questions. It isnâ€™t akward to wait and then speak.</p>

<p>Also, itâ€™s not your respo to overly try to make a situation pleasant. Over trying makes situation more akward.</p>

<h1 id="speaking">
<a class="anchor" href="#speaking" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Speaking</h1>

<h2 id="agree-to-what-you-find-right">
<a class="anchor" href="#agree-to-what-you-find-right" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Agree to what you find right.</h2>

<p>Often someone interrupts us or are in a emotional state and are continuing to talk. Let them speak and then agree to the points you agree with. This helps establish a common base for further conversations.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-dont-understand-something-re-iterate-what-the-person-is-saying-and-ask-if-its-right">
<a class="anchor" href="#if-you-dont-understand-something-re-iterate-what-the-person-is-saying-and-ask-if-its-right" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>If you donâ€™t understand something, re-iterate what the person is saying and ask if itâ€™s right.</h2>

<p>Specially in complex or emotional issues, understanding someone is hard. Doing the aboves means that youâ€™d have understood better and the person knows you have understood better.</p>

<h2 id="ask-neutral-questions">
<a class="anchor" href="#ask-neutral-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ask neutral questions</h2>

<p>Specially on text messages.</p>

<p>To understand neutral questions itâ€™s more effective to understand itâ€™s alternative. Loaded questions.</p>

<p>A loaded question is where you already pick a side.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Loaded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My friend lied to me about having a job. What should I do in this situation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neutral:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If someone lies about themselves? What should be done? Or how should one think about it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two techniques:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove references. Keep everything third person.</li>
  <li>Use phrases like how should one think about this.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="think-before-you-say-and-stay-in-the-realm-of-truth">
<a class="anchor" href="#think-before-you-say-and-stay-in-the-realm-of-truth" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Think before you say and stay in the realm of truth</h2>

<p>This can be hard at times. But think before saying, pausing is okay. Telling that you need a moment is okay. Then stay in the realm of truth and say exactly how you think or feel.</p>

<p>We look even dumber when we say something without actually knowing. Therefore if you donâ€™t know something say that you donâ€™t know and ask for help.</p>

<h2 id="express-and-explain-better">
<a class="anchor" href="#express-and-explain-better" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Express and explain better</h2>

<p>Point to or give examples specially about you feel. Slow down. Speak slower. Be congizent of your emotions. Are you feeling too high or too low.</p>

<p>Ask properly and exactly what you want. Be ready to negotiate. Explain how it might benefit them.</p>

<p>If you are unsure about something, ask clarifying question or ask them how you should think about something.</p>

<h2 id="when-talking-give-the-choice-to-other-person">
<a class="anchor" href="#when-talking-give-the-choice-to-other-person" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>When talking give the choice to other person</h2>

<p>Instead of saying: Iâ€™ll come to your house this Sunday (uninvited)?</p>

<p>Say: Can I come to your house?</p>

<p>Ask instead of commanding.</p>

<h2 id="keep-things-civilized">
<a class="anchor" href="#keep-things-civilized" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Keep things civilized</h2>

<p>We donâ€™t want to cross someoneâ€™s boundary. Itâ€™s not worth it.</p>

<h2 id="dont-attack-the-person">
<a class="anchor" href="#dont-attack-the-person" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Donâ€™t attack the person</h2>

<p>Everyone is human. Attack the specific activity and explain why.</p>

<p>Everyone has an ego. You too. And everyone is trying to figure things out with information they have.</p>

<h1 id="if-you-had-an-argument">
<a class="anchor" href="#if-you-had-an-argument" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>If you had an argument</h1>

<p>Connect with them later. Lighten the mood. Tell them sorry with parts you messed up or slipped. Try to reach understanding.</p>

<hr>
<p>These things have to be automatic. It isnâ€™t ideal to keep thinking about these. Pick on one area at a time to work on.</p>
