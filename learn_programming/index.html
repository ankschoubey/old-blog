    <p>The following is a beginner-focused essay.</p>

<p>I was a dumb programmer for the most part. I knew syntax and understood solutions to problems but could not solve them myself.</p>

<p>The speed of my progress was slow because there was no need for me to code well. My academic assignments were relatively easy.</p>

<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>For my first programming language (C), I watched YouTube while writing all syntaxes by hand. The video taught me the importance of indentations.</p>

<h2 id="algorithm-and-competitions">Algorithm and Competitions</h2>

<p>I had to prepare for a job interview and coding competitions. So I started practising on HackerRank.</p>

<h3 id="book-think-like-a-programmer">Book: Think Like A Programmer</h3>

<p>I knew syntax pretty well but could not write code myself. I always needed a tutorial.</p>

<p>I came across a YouTube series and book of the same name:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKQ5LYb497AZIZe9dBWy8GwLluVaMQVj0">Think Like A Programmer</a>.</p>

<p>I watched all the videos, read books and tried applying them. I was not good initially thought I had learned some ways to estimate what end program would look.</p>

<p>My thoughts were getting structured.</p>

<h3 id="book-automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python">Book: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</h3>

<p>I knew beginner level Java. I wanted to automate some parts of my computer but found it very difficult to do.</p>

<p>I had learned the syntax of Ruby. Ruby was huge at that time.</p>

<p>I have hesitated to learn Python. I did not want to revisit the same things with different syntax. But the Automate The Boring Stuff book was compelling.</p>

<p>I started reading the book and would often read and try out cheatsheets. I even had cheat sheets printed out.</p>

<p>Python reduced the complexity of development. I was able to focus less on syntax and more on what the code does.</p>

<h3 id="book-cracking-the-coding-interview">Book: Cracking the Coding Interview</h3>

<p>I was getting better. This book improved it further.</p>

<p>I did not solve all the problems. I had read through the theory.</p>

<h2 id="practicing">Practicing</h2>

<p>I build all my academic projects myself without asking for help. That helped me a lot.</p>

<p>I was trying to build things for myself. Like</p>
<ul>
  <li>a python script that would automatically empty desktop.</li>
  <li>A python selenium script that would log in to Facebook and wish Happy Birthday to people.</li>
  <li>A script to download Anime.</li>
</ul>

<p>It took around four years. I wasted the first three years and got focused on the last one.</p>
