<p>Responsibility</p>

<p>Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities voluntarily and facing your fears, you’ll avoid being nihilistic.</p>

<p>So, pick the heaviest weight you can take and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then at least you can know, “Dumb as I am, I can at least push a thing from point A to point B” <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Taking on responsibility voluntarily/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you’ll have your life sorted.</p>

<p><strong>Role Models</strong>:  Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), Jordan Peterson</p>

<p>Structure of this post:</p>

<p>In each value described below, a few elements are common:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Description of the value</li>
  <li>What’s the best thing that would happen if the value is followed?</li>
  <li>What’s thing that would happen if the value is not followed?</li>
  <li>A few core habits surrounding a value.</li>

<p>Extreme Ownership:</p>

<p>Nothing outside your own power is effecting your life.</p>

<p>Your life. You choose.</p>

<p>Do</p>

<p>Don’t just think DOn’t just talk or dream. None of that matter. The only thing that matters is do. <sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There is nothing more important than taking care of yourself like someone you can for.</p>

<p>Because if you don’t you become burden on others</p>

<p>My physical health
My mental health
My family’s physical health
My family mental health
Friends
Work
Money: buys you freedom
Time outside of work</p>

<p>Take on more responsibility and everyone/universe will reward you more.</p>

<p>When people come to you with respo. You should accept it.</p>

<p>With great power comes create respo.</p>

<hr />

<p>it is good for you to become a person you can admire.</p>

<p>To push beyond what’s typical</p>

<p>Do it for yourself.</p>

<p>Respo and Courage:</p>

<p>Imagine who you would be if you didn’t stop.</p>

<p>You have to move forward.
Waiting makes you shrink.
If you don’t know what to do. Pick something and walk towards it. You’re not where you were.</p>

<p>No one is comming to save you.</p>

<p>God make you a man and gave you enough ability to save yourself.</p>

<p>I am not what happened to me. I am what I choose to become.</p>

<p>You cannot help everyone. Focus on yourself first.</p>

<p>You cannot give up on yourself for anyone else. You have your goals and priorities.</p>
