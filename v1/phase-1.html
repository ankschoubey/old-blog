    <h3 id="why-did-i-do-the-phase-1-challenge">Why did I do the phase 1 challenge?</h3>

<p>After 75 Hard, I was in really good shape. It might have been the best shape of my life.</p>

<p>The reason to start 75 Hard was depression. During the end of the phase, I was almost out of it.</p>

<p>I was supposed to take a 10-day break before starting phase 1. But the 10-day break turned into a 30-day break and this was because I was trying to time it with lunch with friends. That timing got postponed multiple times, so I started the challenge anyway because I had my IBS symptoms return. So I had to start the challenge again with urgency. I declared to family and friends that I’ll start the challenge. And I did.</p>

<h3 id="differences">Differences</h3>

<p>I planned how I would get everything done. I had become good solid with 75 Hard rules. Adding Phase 1 rules would be a bit challenging.</p>

<p>I listened to the podcast again and noted down the rules of the Phase 1 challenge.</p>

<p>I decided to take a picture early in the morning so that I wouldn’t fail it like last time. And I did.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ankushchoubey.com/v1/75-hard">75 hard tasks</a> were the same as I did before so in this post I’ll describe the new activities.</p>

<h4 id="3-power-list">3 Power List</h4>

<p>The power list was the most ambiguous part. In some places, it was written to be 3 tasks.
And some places it was 3 additional tasks over the 5 tasks.</p>

<p>In the podcast, Andy said when ambiguous pick the hardest so I picked the 8 tasks.</p>

<p>And it was hard. I was doing my tasks till 2 AM on multiple days.</p>

<p>Later, I realized that I wasn’t prioritizing tasks early in the day. Rather I was waiting for the night before doing my tasks.</p>

<p>So, <strong>I started prioritizing my tasks early.</strong></p>

<h4 id="deleting-whatsapp-and-youtube">Deleting WhatsApp and YouTube</h4>

<p>I was over-prepared for the power list.
I deleted WhatsApp from my phone and decided not to use it for 30 days from phone. I could use it from Laptop if needed. But not the phone. 13 days before the end of the challenge, WhatsApp on my laptop got logged out and I could not log in.
I had also deleted YouTube like I did in 75 Hard.</p>

<p>Both these helped boost my focus beyond what I thought was possible.</p>

<p>A kind of monk mode.</p>

<h4 id="pomodoro">Pomodoro</h4>

<p>I started using the Pomodoro technique to help me focus. And it helped. I am using a Pomodoro to write this article too.</p>

<p><img src="/images/phase1/5.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h4 id="kind-of-tasks-included">Kind of tasks included</h4>

<p>Listening to the podcast, I knew I could include some tasks that I was trying to make into a habit. But I could only add them for 21 days as after 21 days they get formed.</p>

<p>So I added,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meditation for 10 minutes</li>
  <li>Sleep system (keep phone outside, make the room pitch black, AC on, put the sleep mask on, and sleep)</li>
  <li>Learning and doing power nap</li>
</ul>

<p>I hadn’t done a power nap well so I practiced the jocko way.</p>

<p>After multiple days of not sleeping properly, I realized that sleep was critical. So I had to add the sleep system and power nap to the list and both of them helped.</p>

<p>I also added tasks related to my goals: finding a new high-paying job and writing a series of blog posts on Test Driven Development. I added these too.</p>

<p>During the challenge, I had my depression up. I wasn’t able to do a lot of my other tasks if I didn’t take care of myself enough. I have been going through therapy and decided that these tasks and homework are critical too. So I added the homework and tasks as part of the power list too.</p>

<p><img src="/images/phase1/6.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h4 id="planning-tasks">Planning tasks</h4>

<p>Initially, I had a lot of planning tasks because I didn’t know what to do as part of the power list. I needed to plan what to add.</p>

<p>These plans included:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Plan for how to find a high-paying job</li>
  <li>Plan what to add to the power list</li>
  <li>Plan Test First Test Everything Blogpost.</li>
</ol>

<p>These may seem trivial but they were critical because I lacked direction at the time. And spending time on them did help me form a proper vision for the upcoming days.</p>

<h4 id="splitting-large-tasks-to-1-pomodoro">Splitting Large Tasks to 1 Pomodoro</h4>

<p>In the case of learning tasks and coding tasks, I cannot do many tasks in a day. And if I do a learning task within a day, I will have no comprehension. So I decided to do a minimum of 25 minutes of each task. size of 1 Pomodoro.</p>

<p>This was I had 2 or 3 days of learning I could do for 25 minutes per day.</p>

<p>But I didn’t do 3 Pomodoro in a day and count it as 3 tasks. If I did 3 pomo in a day for a task it would be 1 task only. but if I do 1 pomo each day for 3 days, I would count it as 3 tasks.</p>

<p>My mind didn’t get bored because I was doing so many tasks. It wasn’t the same task. And I had my energy up.</p>

<h3 id="scrum">Scrum</h3>

<p>I started practicing scrum at the end of 75 Hard. I modified my practice and created many boards.</p>

<p>I’ll be writing a blog post on how I implemented Scrum.</p>

<p>Scrum and the Power List were perfect companions in getting my productivity up by around 5 times.</p>

<h4 id="visualization">Visualization</h4>

<p>I changed my visualization a bunch of times.</p>

<h5 id="scientific-visualization">Scientific Visualization</h5>

<p>For visualization, I listened to Andrew Huberman’s podcast on visualization. And that helped me clarify how to visualize better.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Think in first person</li>
  <li>Visualize for 7-15 seconds.</li>
  <li>Repeat the visualization multiple times</li>
  <li>Involve eye movement</li>
  <li>Keep the number of senses low.</li>
  <li>Label the visualization. Then practice saying the label before starting the activity in the real world.</li>
  <li>Visualization is not a replacement for real-world activity. But it can enhance it. And it can help preserve the activity when you are not able to do the real-world activity.</li>
  <li>Have clear start and stop signs that you visualize and imagine yourself stopping.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="core-values">Core Values</h5>

<p>I wrote a vision of how I would implement my core values and imagine myself going through them.</p>

<p>I practiced many aspects, especially the morning routine. Over the weeks through visualization, I was able to get less groggy and being able to do morning rituals at a nice pace.</p>

<iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/uXjVM1AleJk=/?moveToViewport=-1471,-1120,3030,1917&amp;embedId=289337874145" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="fullscreen; clipboard-read; clipboard-write" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h5 id="modifications">Modifications</h5>

<p>I also sometimes visualize what I plan to do, or what problems I am facing and how could I solve them. These were very reflective and forward-planning sessions that were very helpful.</p>

<h5 id="app">App</h5>

<p>I used the Oak meditation app for a 10-minute visualization. I would ring after every 2 min, so I could keep my focus.</p>

<h5 id="time">Time</h5>

<p>I found EOD to be the worst time as I was too sleepy and having visualization as the last item on the list was annoying.</p>

<p>I did visualization mostly before bed. However, I experimented with morning visualization. Especially during the morning bathroom, which was the most productive. I had to force myself to visualize as I wanted to get the task off my plate so that I could sleep better.</p>

<h3 id="cold-shower">Cold shower</h3>

<p>Cold showers were the simplest. I would come home from a walk, and put on hot water first. Then put a 5-minute timer and turn cold.</p>

<p>Someday I will use music and someday I will not use music.</p>

<p>Overall it was simple.</p>

<h2 id="result">Result</h2>

<p>My weight went from 73Kgs to 69.8 Kgs.</p>

<p><img src="/images/phase1/1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="/images/phase1/3.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="/images/phase1/4.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>My confidence went up infinitely. And it’s hard to understand why. People have been coming and talking to me. Asking me if I am a college student. They are amazed when I say, I’m 26.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I learned that 75 hard was much much easier than Phase 1. But I was able to do it fully.</li>
  <li>I lacked the focus to do tasks in the early part of the day. Which would lead to me doing tasks at the end of the day.</li>
</ol>

<p>WhatsApp is not necessary.</p>

<h3 id="its-more-fun-to-switch-between-work-and-fun-than-to-just-do-either">It’s more fun to switch between work and fun than to just do either</h3>

<p>The switch between work when doing the challenge and having fun in life when not doing the challenge really makes a big difference.</p>

<p>I couldn’t continue to work non-stop while not on the challenge. It was because I was on a challenge that I was able to complete the tasks.</p>

<p>When the challenge was over, the fun tasks that I used to enjoy became even more enjoyable. :)</p>

<h3 id="focus-in-the-early-part-of-the-day">Focus in the early part of the day</h3>

<p>I treated EOD like a deadline where all the work gets done just before the deadline.</p>

<p>This leads to a lot of stress.</p>

<p>Later I started doing work earlier in the day so that I could have more time later. :) And that helped.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-am-experimenting-to-do-after-phase-1">What I am experimenting to do after phase 1?</h2>

<p>For me, Phase 1 was not sustainable. But there were many valuable things I learned. Here are some things I have planned.</p>

<h3 id="start-consuming-protein-in-drink-form">Start consuming protein in drink form</h3>

<p>Either protein shake or sattu milkshake. This should reduce the effect of not having a diet for at least 30 days.</p>

<h3 id="continue-exercising">Continue exercising</h3>

<p>I like the gym. It’s fun and I get to meet my friends.</p>

<h3 id="do-the-5-critical-item-power-list">Do the 5 critical item power list</h3>

<p>The amount of productivity was infinite and I want to continue it.</p>

<h3 id="30-days-of-munching-and-traveling">30 days of Munching and Traveling</h3>

<p>I want to enjoy life for 30 days so I have a list of activities.</p>
