## Approaching TDD To Become a 5x developer

Hi. Welcome to **Testing First Test Everything** series. In this series of articles, you'll learn how you can increase your development skill by 5 times by learning something that ensures:

1. You always produce logical bug-free code.
2. You produce extremely maintainable code.
3. You code at a fast speed.
4. You produce automatic documentation for anyone else to read.

I was a pretty good developer when I learned TDD, but after I spend around 2-3 months learning TDD, I saw that my coding skills became way to sharp. This series covers the philosophy of TDD along with practical examples.

Try to practice the exercises in the language of your choice and upload them to GitHub ðŸ™‚. And if you want just share the link of your repo. I'd love to see it.

The series of posts below is completely free. So, I'd really appreciate it if you share this with your friends via LinkedIn or Twitter, if you find value! This would help get more eyes on the series.

If you have any questions reach out to me either by email or on LinkedIn. And I'll respond. Your questions and feedback would make things better for everyone.
