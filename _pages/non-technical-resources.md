# Non Technical Resources

I read/consume many resources and I thought this would be a good way to link to up and thus avoid  writing blogposts on these topics.

In these resources, try to only consume the parts you need. Let go or parts you don't need.

        - [The Best Answer to "What's Your Expected Salary?" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-mNcEctZQY)
            - Under no circumstances do you know what it's like to work there. And you don't know.
            - What's the budget? What does the position pay at Digite?
            - If you give me a range, it's lower. :)
            - Compensation is important to me. I want to look at the value of working at your company. What I work on? Who I get to work? Training Opportunities? Other benefits and all the other opportunities. And based on that I'll be able to give you a much better idea on what I'd be expecting. Right now, it would be uneducated on my part. And/or I'm looking out for the best deal.
            - You are gonna make a more educated guess.
