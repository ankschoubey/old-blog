## Non Technical Resources

I read/consume many resources and I thought this would be a good way to link to up and thus avoid  writing blogposts on these topics.

In these resources, try to only consume the parts you need. Let go or parts you don't need.

      - कर्म करो और फल की चिंता मत करो'। फल की इच्छा रखते हुए भी कोई काम मत करो। जब इच्छित फल की हमें प्राप्ति नहीं होती है तो हमें दुख होता है। अतः सुखी रहना है तो सिर्फ कर्म करो और वह भी निष्काम भाव से।
      - गीता में कुल सात सौ श्लोक हैं। गीता में ज्ञान को सर्वोच्च स्थान दिया गया है। ज्ञान की प्राप्ति से ही मनुष्य की सभी जिज्ञासाओं का समाधान होता है, इसीलिए गीता को सर्वशास्त्रमयी भी कहा गया है।

        <div style="display:none">
            - Under no circumstances do you know what it's like to work there. And you don't know.
            - What's the budget? What does the position pay at Digite?
            - If you give me a range, it's lower. :)
            - Compensation is important to me. I want to look at the value of working at your company. What I work on? Who I get to work? Training Opportunities? Other benefits and all the other opportunities. And based on that I'll be able to give you a much better idea on what I'd be expecting. Right now, it would be uneducated on my part. And/or I'm looking out for the best deal.
            - You are gonna make a more educated guess.
