Welcome to the philosophy section. Here I dive deep into topics that affect us directly. The aim is to discover and develop practical tools to live a better life. This exploration ranges from human needs, habits, core values to communication, negotiation, and more.

The TLDR of all these articles is this:

- Be healthy. Health is most important.
- Develop and rely on good habits and core values. They provide good default fallbacks.
