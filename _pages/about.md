Hola, Iâ€™m Ankush!

I am a programmer who loves everything technology: Web Development, Deep Learning, DevOps to everything that Elon Musk does.

I am an extrovert, a slow thinker, curious and love finding a different point of view.

I live in Navi Mumbai, India.

This blog is the way I share my thoughts.

I love hearing from people, so please email me at ankushchoubey@outlook.com
