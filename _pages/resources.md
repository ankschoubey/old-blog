I read/consume many resources and I thought this would be a good way to link to up and thus avoid  writing blogposts on these topics.

<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ '/assets/resources.js' | relative_url }}"></script>

    - 2022 Aug 22
        - Note: 
        2022 Aug 22: For plugin architecture, the whole product should be made pluggable. That is even first party features should be developed as plugin. Which means there will be almost nothing in the core.
