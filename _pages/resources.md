I read/consume many resources and I thought this would be a good way to link to up and thus avoid  writing blogposts on these topics.

    When doing requirement gathering
    - Always have questions. 
        - Be prepared. The best way to prepare is to have a document ready with all questions and concerns.
    - Only when requirements are approved start working
        - All work until requirements aren't finished is experimental code.  (Spike Code, POC, Hopefully not MVP.)
        - All of these are just to gather more and clarity requirements and what is possible.

## Architecture
- Plugin Architecture #notImplementedYet
    - 2022 Aug 22
        - Note: 
        2022 Aug 22: For plugin architecture, the whole product should be made pluggable. That is even first party features should be developed as plugin. Which means there will be almost nothing in the core.

    - In any friendship/relationship/coperation. the most important thing is trust. If you can trust, only then you'll move forward.
    - This includes and is not limited to the world around you.
    - You calling Uber in a different country and getting home safely driven by a stranger is all trust based.
