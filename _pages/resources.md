I read/consume many resources and I thought this would be a good way to link to up and thus avoid  writing blogposts on these topics.

    - When doing requirement gathering
    - Always have questions. 
        - Be prepared. The best way to prepare is to have a document ready with all questions and concerns.
    - Only when requirements are approved start working
        - All work until requirements aren't finished is experimental code.  (Spike Code, POC, Hopefully not MVP.)
        - All of these are just to gather more and clarity requirements and what is possible.
