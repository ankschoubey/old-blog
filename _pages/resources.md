{% include replace_nav_with_icons.html %}


I read/consume many resources and I thought this would be a good way to link to up and thus avoid  writing blogposts on these topics.

<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ '/assets/resources.js' | relative_url }}"></script>

<div id='resource-holder'>

</div>
