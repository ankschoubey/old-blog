  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A lot of companies make the mistake of outsourcing what they are good at or what their core business is.</p>

<h2 id="some-outsource-everything">Some outsource everything</h2>

<p>You will see a lot of carmakers just putting their brand over something. Like Suzuki which just puts in a logo on Maruti Ertica which is developed by Toyota. Some even put their brand on cosmetics which has nothing to do with cars.</p>

<p>Or what a lot of Indian smartphone makers did. Micromax and Lava which just bought products from Oppo and put their logo on it.</p>

<p>A few years pass and original manufactures became so good at developing and marketing that they started to sell themself and took over the market.</p>

<h2 id="some-build-almost-everthing-themself">Some build almost everthing themself</h2>

<p>There are companies like Tesla and SpaceX which build everything themself.</p>

<p>They realized that building themself was not just cheaper but they could iterate fast and build better because it was custom made for themself.</p>

<p>As a result, not only they built better products but they develop a lot of Intellectual Assets, IPs, and Patents that their competitors could not replicate.</p>

<p>Tesla builds itâ€™s own software and CPUs for auto-pilot technology which rest are taking help from Google.</p>

<p>SpaceX designs and builds everything on its own. While Boeing buys existing products.</p>

<p>Apple outsources production but still designs everything by itself. While rest rely heavily on Google for phone software and Microsoft for PC software.</p>

<h2 id="some-companies-take-control-back">Some companies take control back.</h2>

<p>Apple is taking back control of its microprocessors because it realized that it can ship better products if it designs the chips themself.</p>

<p>And it is not something that they just decided to do overnight. It must have been planned for years and developed for years.</p>

<p>And still, the rolling out is a 2-year transition giving everyone enough room to adapt. And from what current iPads perform it can be assumed that these new computers will perform better.</p>

<h2 id="ofcourse-you-should-outsource-if-">Ofcourse you should outsource if â€¦</h2>

<p>A large Hollywood studio need not worry about their backend software. Itâ€™s not their core business. Their business is making great movies.</p>

<p>A hospital need not build itâ€™s own hospital management software. Either they just buy it or outsource it.</p>

<p>But as discussed above there may be advantages to building it themself ðŸ™ƒ.</p>
