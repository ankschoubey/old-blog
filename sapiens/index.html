<h2 id="why-this-summary">Why this summary</h2>

<p>The book took around two months to complete. I am a slow reader. I am trying to write this as a way to better process what I understood.</p>

<p>This summary may spoil your reading experience if you have not read the book yourself.</p>

<p>The order of points is random.</p>

<h2 id="the-book">The book</h2>

<p>The book is a brief history. It transitions fast and beautifully from one topic to another.</p>

<p>It also presents arguments and counter-arguments in a way that tries to explain the whole thing from maximum points of view. This kind of writing and thinking is something I aspire.</p>

<h2 id="lessons">Lessons</h2>

<h3 id="cousins">Cousins</h3>

<ol>
  <li>We had a lot of cousin humans. Once upon a time, Around <strong>six species of humans</strong> roamed the earth at the once.</li>
  <li>
<strong>We are not unique</strong>. 3 billion years ago our universe was born. It will stay for billions. We are not even the human species that has survived the longest (as of yet).</li>
  <li>There are countless species. We are just specie that got lucky thanks to our intellect and imagined realities.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="imagined-realities">Imagined Realities</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>History is random</strong>. There are cause and effect to certain events but there is no reason why history could not have turned in some other way.</li>
  <li>Religion is a recent thing. (10,000 years ago).</li>
  <li>The way we interact and work together with stranger and form groups larger than 150 is by imaging things.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Societal constructs</strong> like nation, company, ethics, etc are imagined realities shared by billions. It’s so strong that we act according to them in the real world.</li>
  <li>
<strong>There is no justice in history</strong>. Even a human right is an imagined construct. There is nothing in biology that suggest it to be a truth. These constructs do help keep people sane.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="destroyer-of-species">Destroyer of Species</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Huntergathers were healthier</strong> than us but they did not live for that long.</li>
  <li>There is no going back once the Agriculture Revolution started. Why would someone want to go back to hunting?</li>
  <li>We are <strong>Thanos</strong> for other species. Our species has captured and killed and effected almost all animals on earth.</li>
  <li>We don’t look at animals with the same view as we look at other humans. We abolished human slavery but are okay with animal slavery.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="capitalism">Capitalism</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Science is largely a product of Capitalism and politics</strong>.</li>
  <li>Capitalism allowed us to progress fast.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Capitalist if not checked can do anything for money</strong>. Slave trading companies were listed in the London Stock Exchange. This seems kind of similar to current privacy breaching companies or how we farm animals.</li>
  <li>The stock investor would not care what happens in the company. he is just interacted in making a return.</li>
  <li>Government and legal checks are necessary to keep Capitalists in check.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="accepting-ignorance">Accepting Ignorance</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The <strong>scientific revolution was a result of Europeans accepting that they are ignorant</strong>. That they don’t know things.</li>
  <li>The reason the Scientific revolution took place in Europe instead of India or China (even if Asia controlled 80% of world GDP) is because of social constructs.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Asians did not accept their ignorance</strong> and did not venture out to find answers to things they did not know.</li>
  <li>New material discovered increase progress rapidly.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="unification">Unification</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The 3 things that brought humankind together; <strong>Empired, Religion, Money</strong>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Money crossed lines which religion could not</strong>. Everybody loves money.</li>
  <li>There have been many types of money and does not include just a coin.</li>
  <li>We are all influenced by European culture. No country has an original culture. It’s a mix.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="math">Math</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Maths allowed us to predict the future</strong>.</li>
  <li>Time and timetable tracking is recent. Though it is very efficient.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="buddhism">Buddhism</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Western liberals mix their view with the Buddhist view.</li>
  <li>The Buddhist view is not that the happiness in individual and it must be protected.</li>
  <li>The main part is the <strong>internal states are fleeting</strong> and they change every moment. <strong>There is no point in chasing after it</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="credit">Credit</h3>

<p><strong>Banks and the whole financial system are built on credit</strong>. They provide more money than they have hoped for a future return. This is a large contributor to human progress.</p>

<h3 id="lone-individual">Lone Individual</h3>

<p><strong>Individual needs are now satisfied by state</strong> and organizations instead of family and community.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want money, you can take a loan.</li>
  <li>if you want an education you go to school.</li>
  <li>if you are unemployed there are un-employment schemes.</li>
  <li>if you are old, there are retirement schemes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="transendance">Transendance</h3>

<p>Humans have <strong>transcended genetic boundaries</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We learn faster and adapt quicker. Unlike other animals whose genes dictate what they do.</li>
  <li>We have created medicines and technologies that far exceed and extend our natural limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<ol>
  <li>A band of good communication sapiens of 500 could beat Neanderthals with a pack of 5 times more.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Gossip is natural to us</strong>. Gossip conveys important information like who to avoid, what to do, what not to do, etc which helps us be safe.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="peace-in-our-time">Peace in our time</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Humans have been safer than ever</strong>. And we seem to be moving towards more peace.</li>
  <li>Compared to history, the decolonization of colonies has been relatively peaceful. <strong>Everyone seems to be tired of war</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="nature">Nature</h3>

<p><strong>Biology is always changing</strong>. It is never constant or fixed. If you go by this line of thinking, more than human 2 genders are possible and biology won’t have any problem with it.</p>
