# Love is not Enough

Love makes you think and therefore act ir-rationally. 
1. Love does not equal compatibility
2. Love does not solve your relationship problems
3. Love is not always worth sacrificing yourself

# Aiming for Compatibility is a better AIM

# Earned

A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be boughtâ€”they must be earned. [^7]

# Rejecting

Modern societies are abundant. 

# The one

You are not a perfect being. Neither will be someone who you have a relationship with.

# Fantasy



# Sex

Persuing pleasure for it's own sake is a problem.

Sex masks problems. Sex is one of human's core desire.

You'll get bored from Sex.

# When Love

They did not fall in love with you when they saw you first. Or that when they knew you had a lot of things.

They fell in love with you because you thought of making coffee for them early in the morning. When you brought the chocolates they so like. [^1]
