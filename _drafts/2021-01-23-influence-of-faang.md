A companies valuations can be seen as hour influencial the company is. As of Jan 2021, FAANG companies are most influencial companies with a very high market cap.

These companies are hailed by software engineers and the competition to get is tough.

For the below details I am excluding Netflix as it not as big as the other 4.

The aim of the post is not to say that FAANG are good or bad. This post initially started as analysis but the post was getting too large so to keep things short details by providing examples.

These are some examples of how much influence FAANG influence us:

## Attention

Example 1: 

A lot of products are ad models. If the amount of time a person spends on the product is high, the more ad revenue can come in.

Since user's attention has now shifted from physical to digital, grabbing user's attention in online space is important.

Example 2:
A survey in ___ showed that people spent 90% of time on application created by top companies liek FAANG. and less than 10% on other developers.

Think about how much time you spent on services provided by FANG companies including search engine, video, browser, social media and messaging.

I personally spend about 6-9 hours each day on one of their products.

## Data

A lot of FAANG services are data driven. They require a huge amount of data. Though Apple's current stand seems to be based on protecting user privacy.

Data is collected from almost every service and specially squeezed from the free onces.

Even cloud computing services collect a huge amount of data.

Example 4:

## Money and Small Businesses

Most FAANG companies benifit from being middlemen between 2 parties.

They earn data and improve their services on user side, they use the improved service to provide better advertisements.

Example 5:
Out of every dollar a VC invests into a startup, 40 cents goes to Facebook, Amazon and Google. [^1]

Example 6:
Plus every small company needs to be careful of the moves made by FAANG as if a FAANG decides to enter the same market as a small business, the odds are really low that the small business will succeed. [^2]

## Power

Example 7:
- Amazon Web Services, the most profitable of Amazon's companies, control nearly half of Global Cloud Infrastructure.
- A few years ago, a single code bug caused a lot of we known websites to crash. Websites like Netflix, Tinder, etc.

Example 8:
Facebook and Google have been known to influence attention and start mass movements.
