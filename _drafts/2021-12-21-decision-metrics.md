Percentage Change

## Percentage Of Plan Followed

It often happens with habits that we aim for a perfect streak. Aiming for a perfect streak is not ideal because once a streak breaks we get demotivated.

Aiming for a streak undermines the progress made on other days.

A better alternative is to aim for percent of times/days we followed the plan within a specific time period.

Example:
Suppose you want to not slip into a habit, a useful thing would be:
- Within a month, I would make sure to have a 80/85% success rate.
- So if you follow slip up 4 days in a month, it's still 86.66% which is success!

## Effort taken: +1 | -1 aim for 0

This may sound evil at first but I'll justify it later.

Ideally, in a relationship, you want to aim for a roughly 50% partnership.

If you are putting too much effort or putting too little, efforts are not equal and relationship fails.
It's not right for yourself and for the other person to have this kind of skewness. The person who is putting more effort, would start feeling bad eventually.

So +1 |-1 aim for 0 is for such conditions. 

Pick a time period, let's say a week or a month, start from 0 and add 1 each time you put and effort, add -1 if the partner does. If the number is too away from 0, try to make it 0. If it's too positive, reduce your efforts. If it's more negative, put more effort.

In case it's positive, wait, reduce your efforts, spend time during something else.

If it's too high in positive, reduce your effort even more. It's the only way to make sure things are okay.

+ 1 | -1 is relationships means you are not forcing anyone.

Example 2:

Can be using for production/consuption of technology/content.

Ideally you don't want to waste all your time just consuming information/or just enjoying. You have to put in the work. 

+1 each time you consume. -1 each time you produce something aim for 0. reset every week or two weeks or month.

## Avoid grey area

and have to courage to move on.

If you are in grey area, you may have already lost. You'll try to rationalize and do things.

move on

## Figure out what does not need a decision and skip it


## As long as X, nothing matters,

as long as code is clearer, deleting/refactoring code does not matter,

as long as truth is found/told, nothing else matters.

as long as I am peaceful, nothing matters.

## Listen to your conscience

Whole body yes. You are the same space of making decisions. You want things to be intuitive. if you are doing something and you feel it in you or your conscience says to do something, listen to it. The critic. 

## Take decision at 80% confidence.

Mindset.

What are you trying to not say. What are you trying to not do.

What are you not speaking up againt rules over you.

Failure is success over long run as long as it is reversable. It bad to not take risks. It;s only okay is you take rists.

If you make progress 80% of the time. that good enough. You don't need perfect streak.


## WIP Limits

Have it for everything. How much can I get done/ How much context switch can I have?

## Be decisive

Pick a decision and stick to it for a while. Some decision is better than indecision/unable to decision. You skipping the decision is also a decision.
