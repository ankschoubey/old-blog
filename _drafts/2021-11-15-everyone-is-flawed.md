title: Everyone is flawed
---

This is rewording of [Opinions/Events are not black and white.](h/black_white/) applied to people,

Everyone is stupid. Everyone is genius. Everyone is flawed. #World is random.

There is no perfect being. If you think someone is perfect, you probably don’t know them enough or you’re probably still a child.

Everyone is dealing the cards they have been given the best way then can.

And social media is mostly fake.
