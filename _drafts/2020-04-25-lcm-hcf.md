Factor: A factor is a number which completely divides another number

a \mid b

so

you can say:
2 \mid 4

2 completely divides 4.
or 4 is divisible by 2.

Multiple: A multiple is a number obtained when you multple something to a number.

4 is a multiple of 2.

You can multiple the number 2 with 2 and you get 4.


Factors and multiples are play of each other.
