There are many kids who at a very young age learn a relatively hard skill like piano. They often get the title of being a child prodigy.

This categorization means that the child

sister so couldn't hear what to do but this often ignores the this this is on the premise that the child was born with some special abilities skill to learn or a mindset that that can only be genetically available in some cases it mind before you there are unfair advantages 

Life isn't fair for everyone there are always on fair advantages but this often undermines the amount of effort that the child has put in to something hard to learn if you take a look at 

most child prodigies they started really on the event four years of five years old old started learning the craft

because they spend daily five years crafting it 

this thing is kind of hard and a corporate environment where The years of experience is what is given favour more than the ability of the person to get the job done
