Prototying helps you visualize what you are developing faster and cheaper way. In a product lifecycle the earlier you fix problems, the less costly it will be to develop.

Paper Prototying


Paper protoype can include more than apps. It can also include physical products.

Paper prototying is cheapest way to iterate as paper is nearly free.

Paper prototying also forces you to see the gist of the product. It should not be fancy.

If it is fancy, you and other's won't find it easy to notice faults. it should be as rough as possible.

Try to do it once. It is not only fun it clarifies your thoughts by 500%.

A protoype makes it easy to develop code later. It is expensive to change the design whule coding.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, prototype is worth a thousand meetings.
