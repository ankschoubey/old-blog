One of the fascinating things about Apple is that they control pretty much everything.

Apple controls everything.

The control the operating system, the hardware and also very much control how to present themselves to the world.

Apple has always been great at product launch presentations. Their way has been simple. They don't over explain things. And they usually gloss over the technical specs (or don't even mention it) and focus more on
• how it would feel to use the product.
• how the craftsmanship behind the product went

If you look at their social media they don't even allow for comments. And they don't even try to sell you the product. What they show is the experience you will have after you will have the product.
