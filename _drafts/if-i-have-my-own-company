## If 

If someday you are head of a company. And you seem to have a monopoly or you are big enough and a smaller company does something innovative. Don't copy them. Let them grow.

Maybe you offer to buy them a little (not more. Little). But if they don't want you that's fine. But don't copy their product.

Free market create a lot of value. In the end their product may even revolutionize your life in the long run.

## Rights and Responsibilities

Employee Rights and Responsibility

## A Thought Experiment:

What if you were only ethical in your business. Ie. You'll only sell what other people truely want at a price that is reasonable.

A few things will happen:
1. At least initially you'll be happy. Or atleast you'll be happy in terms of ethics.
2. The world will seem to go ahead of you. Since almost everyone is cheating. Manipulating people to buy unnecessary things that they don't need.
3. Your product line will be very small. Detergents, Clothes, Food, Medical.
4. Your company size will be likely small since you don't make a lot of profit. and you don't have venture funding since you are not a quote ponzi scheme startup.
5. You'll suffer. Unnecessarily. Your family will suffer from income loss.
