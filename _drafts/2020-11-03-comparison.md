title: Comparison in Performance Evaluation

While evaluation performance don’t compare one person to another

I see managers make this mistake a lot they compare one persons performance to another persons performance.

Though this may seem good for some things like giving an award to the best performer a better approach would be compare the person with his whole past performance

This not just gives everyone a fair chance but also is more accurate Level of judging improvement.

So in math system it would be like change in percentage rather than change in value. I’ll percentage growth instead of growth in value.

That’s almost cannot be used as a way for new hires sense the person in charge know so little about them.
