I don't like most environment non-profits.
- They have no reason to exist.
- They have sub-par performance.
- They don't bring good solution to the table.
- They are part of cancel culture.

On the other hand for profit companies survive and have better performance.

For profit companies offer better and phisable solutions

Jobs

Some for-profit companies I really like in this space are:

- Tesla: Produces a lot of products related to energy consuptions. Popularly electric cars.
- Impossible Burger: Making plant based alternative to animal meat without compresing people's taste and quality
- Neuralink: Trying to make human smart so that if AI and human will be able to work together.
