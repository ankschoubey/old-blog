Reason I read have been reading philosophy is this: "Always choosing long term without significantly reducing short term pleasure.".

These values are sub division of this.

1. Responsibility
2. Nirwana/Peace
3. Telling the Truth and being hyper-realistic.
4. Systems Thinking
5. Inputs Matter
6. Time Matter
7. Courage is calling
8. Team Work

## **Responsibility**: It's not worth having ego but no one will save you.

Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities voluntarily and facing your fears, you'll avoid being nihilistic. 

So, pick the heaviest weight you can take and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then at least you can know, "Dumb as I am, I can at least push a thing from point A to point B" [^1]

Taking on responsibility voluntarily/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you'll have your life sorted.

**Role Models**:  Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), Jordan Peterson

Specifics which may be missed:
- **Look your best**: It's respecful to you and other people. Plus it influences performance and congnition. 

## **Nirwana/Peace**: Don't suffer imagined troubles

Being unhappy is inefficient.

Happiness/Peace is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make [^2]. You can choose to live a certain way that will lead to peace.

To have peace, your brain should be in control in every situation. You have to be mentally tough. 

You need to be peaceful if you want things to be good long term. Develop detachment (not wanting), be less judgemental and optimism. Aiming for peace requires a lot of recognizing, rethinking and flipping/unlearing almost everything.

If you don't believe that you can achieve ultimate peace (Nirwana), you'll have a hard time finding it.

**Role Models**:  Naval Ravikant, Sam Harris, Kapil Gupta, Sadhguru

## **Truth**: Unhide the fog by becoming truth seeking missile. 

Humans aren't rational creatures because we cannot understand or have information about everything at once.

Since we base our decisions on our perceived reality, it is very important to our perceived reality match original reality.

The only truth are facts from nature. All else is opinions/perceptions. Therefore, you can be as truthful as possible but else wise it's just opinions.

Truth is clear and specific.

It is easier to deliver truth to yourself completely.

- Before telling the truth to others deliver truth to yourself completely.
- Be as specific as possible. Eg: Pointing to past event is specific. Being wage means you aren't speaking the truth.
- Test out the truth quickly. Truths are not based on assumptions.
- Accept the truth and let go. Don't over rationalize after one point. 

The only way is to let go of the outcome and to assume that whatever happens in truth is the best thing that can happen.

While dealing with people, you have to ask people multiple times to make sure they tell you everything because often humans tell white lies to not hurt your feelings.

Specifics which may be missed:
- You may have to 

## **Systems**: Become an effortness executioner - 'Everthing is undercontrol'

Aims are good for setting up initial direction. But systems/processes are how you work towards them and beyond them.

Systems allow you to free up your mental RAM. Systems break problems down. They assure that as long as the systems are working right, the direction is right.

Systems can include by are not limited to: trained habits, routines, frameworks, automation, etc.

The goal with systems is to keep them up most of the time. Perfect streak may not be possible unless human component is removed.

Most important systems are habits because they impact our day to day. These are most impactful systems one can have.

## **Inputs Matter**: Catelist

> If information was the answer, we would all be billionares with perfect abs

Our role in the world is essentially to interact with it. All other virtues except peace, are related to output. Doing things that impact the world. Peace is completely internal. Input matters is the interface between external and internal.

We have limited time and limited attention. Like any resource, resource allocation can either help us get better returns or lower our return. The quality and ability to process inputs determines quality of outputs.

Over the long term, you want "inputs" in your life to push yourself in the desired direction. The quality and quantity of inputs needed very dependent on stage of progress and incoming of opportunities.

The quantity of inputs: determines how much demand there is. How much needs to be done.
The quality of inputs: determines how important the input it.

Quantity of inputs:

If you don't prioritise, everything will seem important. You work on everything important at once, your ROI will diminish significantly. It's ideal to work on a few problems at a time. Get it done and solidified and move into other problem. Early sense of progress that comes multitasking if false. Because multitasking is screwing everything up at once.  WIP Limits is a well established technique that would help limit multitasking and context switching.

Quality of Inputs
Compounding is attending a few high quality inputs. 80/20 rule is very applicable to every value. Most things come from small inputs.

By **rejecting** most inputs that don't make sense at the moment, one does not loose anything. Rather the small rejection helps free time and attention to focus on what matters.

It's worth having a system to quickly accept and reject inputs.
- Quantity of inputs: If it's too much you'll not gain much from it. Feeds of any kind, like facebooks newsfeed, instagrams feed, youtube subscription suggestion, continuously news, etc all assume that what's latest "data" is the most important. This data is rarely **information**. Reliable information is what does not change overtime. Therefore best sources are usually not what has come out right now. Also, news/updates of anykind aren't easily transferable. Principles that stay true for longer are better than latest techniques.
- Quality of inputs: Inputs should be a credible source. Non-latest Books are highest form of credible source because it goes through a lot of processing before being published. Similarly for programming, documentation (not stack overflow) is a highest credible source. Though these are credible source, one may be required to get context around the book before reading. For such cases, I find taking to someone/internet resources to be better. What's scarce is usually higher quality.
- Available attention: Reject if you are occupled, WIP limit.
- Explore vs Exploit: Switch between explore and exploit. Reduce your inputs during exploit. Have truly random inputs during explore. But for a short duration only.

Managing Inputs

The first step to managing inputs is to track it. We can only optimise and process what we know exactly. I personally use [notion database](https://www.notion.so/).

Once you have rejected inputs, have inputs tracked and prioritised it's time to work on them the best way possible.

## **Time Matters**: You don't have forever

Time is the most precious finite resource we have. We should make good use of it. If we do, we make time our ally.

Like any resource, one can think of time in numeric terms. This allows us to categorize activities as assets which add back time or liabilities, which take time away. Our goal essentially then is to create more time-assets with high time-ROI.

80% of more of our activities during a given day is not new. They are merely habits that have been repeated.

So essentially, by carefully observing, choosing and forming our habits would lead to more **time-assets** and less **time-liabilities**. Usually, time-assets and time-liabilities are opposites of each other.

Most time-liabilities snap our attention and lead us to caring about wrong things. Therefore, time-assets help us course correct. Therefore, time management is essentially attention management.

Some of the most impactful time-aseets and liabilities are:

| Time-Assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Time Liabilities                                                                                                                                         |

| **Planning**: Even a little bit of planning, something like 10 minutes alone creating a written plan could save hours, days or even years. <br><br>Planning allows course correction. Ideally, don't start working without a plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Rushing**: Though it may seem you are making progress. The probability is higher that you are moving in the wrong direction. It's better to fix a plan |

| **5 Min Rule**: Don't allow yourself to be down or procrastinate for more than 5 minutes. <br><br>During such time ask yourself: Is this worth the return on my time?<br><br>Remember you can't live forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Forever Rule: **The opposite of 5 min rule**: Letting fear/laziness/indecision stop you.                                                                 |
| **WIP Limit**: Focus on a few things and complete them. If your WIP limit is reached, don't add work on newer tasks unless older ones are complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Trying to change people**: You cannot change people. You can suggest but cannot force. Leading by example. It's the best option you have.              |
| **Pomodoro**: Working in Pomodoros keeps you focused. If you can't work with pomodoro, you haven't planned carefully enough.<br><br>To have pomodoro sessions.<br>1. Create a distraction free zone.<br>2. Plan your tasks. Ideally pick a deliverable.<br>3. Put on headphones and play instrumental/[focus music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx65qkgCWNJIs3FPaj8JZhduXSpQ_ZfvL).<br>4. Work on the task using [a Pomodoro app](https://pomofocus.io/).<br>5. Stick to break schedule religiously. Get away from the room during break but no internet. <br><br>One pomodoro is better than zero pomodoro. |                                                                                                                                                          |

During normal decision making, one can calculate ROI of their actions: think about how much time you'll invest and how much return you'll get back.

## **Courage is calling**: Be unstoppable. Break limits.
[^3]

This is probably the most important value that supports all others. It takes courage to tell the truth, act responsibly, detach yourself to be peaceful, build and trusting long term systems, and break the spell of wasting time. And the courage of following the plan and push yourself when time comes. 

Everything worth while is an act of courage.

No one is invincible. It's good and courageous to be vulnerable. To admit to faults and take steps to improve it but it's not okay to be weak.

Courage is exciting. It pushes to act beyond what one believes is possible. So get excited by the challenge and push yourself beyond what you think is possible.

**Role Models**: Jocko Willink, Super Saiyan Blue - Son Goku, Bounce Man - Monkey D Luffy, Byan Mode - Naruto, Batman, James Bond

## **Team Work**: Treat others like you want to be treated

Humans are a social animal. We are node in a network[^1]. The way we act and interact in the network determines the life of everyone. 

We stand on the shoulders of all those who came before us. And we are building a foundation for all those who will come after.

Plus who are we doing all this "core-values" for if we can't even help and be there people around us. One cannot do it alone and it is worthless doing it alone.

There are multiple levels of "team work" and each requires a different approach.
- Everyone else
- Close Friends
- Family and Partner
- Children

This also requires a level of self awareness and knowing how your interaction/quality of relationships can be improved. 

One can be strict with himself but has to be patient with others. And remember that you are probably not right so listen to people carefully -> Openness.

## Which value to refer?
If you are suffering? -> Refer Peace, Responsibility or Courage
If you are not on top of things? -> refer Responsibility, Inputs and Systems
