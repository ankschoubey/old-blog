I had been thinking and writing a lot of article but the amount of time it was taking me was huge.

So, this book eliminates 80% of my future blog posts.

I realized that it would be better that starts with general ideas which I could later look deeply into.

There are total 271 concepts.

# Book Summary

# Introduction

Businesses are opened by ordinary people like us. You don't need to fixate of getting a business angst, certification or imposter syndrome.

### You Don't Need To Know It All

Principles are less. Methods are too many. The one who knows principles can choose his own methods.

You do not need to learn everything. You only need to know a small set of business concepts to make good decisions.

### No Experience Necessary

### Questions, Not Answers

Education is the answer to all questions not just one. If you know how to ask the right question, you'll find answers to your problems faster.

### Mental Models, not Methods

# Business

## Value Creation


## Sales

People don't like being sold. But they love to buy

The sales process starts with a prospects and ends with an exciting new customer and more money in the bank. No sales = No Money = No Business

The best companies are earn trust of their prospects by making them understand why the offer is worth paying for.

### Transaction

There is only one boss, the customer who can fire everyone from CEO down just by spending money somewhere else.

A transaction is exchange of value between two or more party. It is a defining moment in any business.

Sales is the only point in business cycle where resources flowes in. Therefore it is essential to remove any blockers to transaction.

A transaction won't happen if things are not of economic value. Often businesses fail to know what prospects want, therefore it is important to develop MVP and test fast.

When starting a new business, the objective is to make your first profitable transaction: that's the point where your project turns into a business.

IOU's and Promises are not transactions.

### Trust
 
Without a certain amount of trust between the parties, a transaction cannot take place.

The best way to build trust is by overtime dealing fairly and honestly.

You can also signal trust worthyness: online reviews, credit and background check services and financial arrangement like escrow accounts exists to overcome lack of trust between parties. These can be very important in breaking mutual barriers towards transaction.

Easier it is to verify trust worthyness between parties, the better success of transaction.

### Common Ground  

A compromise is the art of diving the cake in such a way that everyone believes that they have the biggest piece.

Common ground is the state of overlaping interest between parties.

Your job is the find where those circles overlap, which is much easier if you understadn what your customer wants or needs.

Common ground is the precondition of any type of transaction. Else the transaction would not make any sense.

Sales isn't about convincing somebody to do something that is not in their interest. The more your interests align the better.

There are many paths to a successful transaction, which is the essense of negotiation.

Negotiation is the process of exporing different common ground.

The more open you are, the more liekly you will ind a acceptable common ground.

### The Pricing Uncertainity Principle

All prices are arbitary and malleable. Pricing is a executive decision. There is nothing stoping you.

But you must be able to support your asking price before a customer accepts it.

If you expect people to pay you good money for what you are offering, you must be able to prove a reason why the offered price is worth paying for.

Auctions are often an efficient way to establist the true market price for something that is difficult to reprove and for which no comparable item exists in the market.

### Four Pricing Method

Replacement Cost Method: How much would it cost to replace?

Replacement cost is usually a cost plus calulator: figure out how much it costs to create, add your desired markup and set your price appropritately.

Market comparison method: How much are other things like this selling for?

Discounted Cash Flow/ Net Present Value method: How much is it worth if it can bring in money over time?

DCF/NPV is used onlt for pricing things that can produce an ongoing cash flow, whoch makes it a very scommon way to price businesses when they're sold or acquired.

The Value Comparison: Who is this particularly valuable to?

You can use other methods to set baseline but Value comparison is usually the optimal way to price since the value of an offer to a specific group can be quite high, resulting in a much better price.
