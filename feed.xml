Logical problems are solved easily. The emotional problem is how we feel.</p>

<p>We seek books that tell us the same thing in a different way that eases how we feel. i.e. how we feel impacts us.</p>

<p><strong>We need a strong why to do things</strong>. And here may be some ways to ease your emotions to do it.</p>

<p>Below are a few mental patterns that can be used to “Make yourself Do it”. Treat these as thought experiments.</p>

<h2 id="thought-experiments">Thought Experiments</h2>

<h3 id="turn-off-your-brain-and-do-it">Turn off your brain. And do it</h3>

<p>Don’t think. Don’t rationalize. You know what the activity is, just do it.</p>

<h3 id="imagine-how-youd-feel-once-you-have-accomplished-this-small-task">Imagine how you’d feel once you have accomplished this small task</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The feeling of accomplishment.</li>
  <li>Not having anything over your head.</li>
  <li>Free to do other things.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="be-mindful-of-how-you-are-feeling-and-then-continue-feeling-it-while-you-do-the-item">Be mindful of how you are feeling and then continue feeling it while you do the item</h3>

<h3 id="just-get-started-and-wait-for-20-min">Just get started and wait for 20 min</h3>

<h3 id="if-you-get-this-task-done-you-dont-have-to-think-about-it-again">If you get this task done, you don’t have to think about it again</h3>

<p>You won’t have anything hanging over your head.</p>

<h3 id="how-will-you-reward-yourself-after-doing-this-task-or-what-will-you-do-during-the-break">How will you reward yourself after doing this task? Or what will you do during the break?</h3>

<h3 id="what-would-this-look-like-if-this-were-easy">What would this look like if this were easy?</h3>

<h3 id="winners-do-it-regardless-of-how-they-feel">Winners do it regardless of how they feel</h3>

<h3 id="make-things-compelling">Make things compelling</h3>

<ol>
  <li>What you do</li>
  <li>Why you do</li>
  <li>How you do</li>
  <li>Where you do</li>
  <li>With whom you do</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="fit-that-image-of-a-brighter-future-in-your-mind">Fit that image of a brighter future in your mind</h3>

<h3 id="if-you-cant-fit-an-image-of-a-brighter-future-imagine-exercising-your-discipline">If you can’t fit an image of a brighter future, imagine exercising your discipline</h3>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Humans are stronger than we things. We need to exercise our wills. The most useful advice I have found is just make yourself do it. Eventually, the reward is so large and obvious that you’ll do it anyways.</p>

<p>I’ll share something personal and long. I learned it from HealthyGamerGG.</p>

<p>You can’t logic your way out of depression.</p>

<h2 id="logical-people-get-depressed-more-and-more-strongly-than-rest">Logical people get depressed more and more strongly than rest</h2>

<p>In normal people depression in 9% of people. If you go to the top 2 percent of high IQ people, it is 36%.</p>

<p>Depression is like auto-immune dysfunction of the mind. It’s your brain turning against itself. The stronger your brain is, the worst it does when it turns against itself.</p>

<p>The more logical someone is, the more they rely on logic to get through. So they have underdevelopment emotional intelligence and awareness.</p>

<p>If you ask them, they’ll describe very logical events. And all those logical events will be true. And since they are true, that makes it more of a reason for them to be depressed. But they won’t describe emotion. Cuz they aren’t in touch with it.</p>

<p>And when someone is emotional, it highjacks their logic. They can be logical and say they are logical. But their assumptions before logic can take place is itself hijacked. So, logic doesn’t work.</p>

<p>For example, a depressed person will more likely see the negatives than the positives.</p>

<p>Plus, smart depressed people have the habit of saying to themselves, “I should have had this figured out. But I haven’t had it figured out.” This creates shame.</p>

<h2 id="the-way-out-is-to-develop-emotional-awareness">The way out is to develop emotional awareness</h2>

<p>The way out of this is for the logical person to develop emotional awareness. To recognize what they are feeling and process the feeling independently of logic. To develop perspective.</p>

<p>It’s after they have processed their emotions independent of logic, that they feel a bit better and then they can use their logical brains i.e. when emotional one shouldn’t use their logic.</p>

<p>He also said that the processing of emotions can be crying too. After that, you can use logic. Or talking. Or meditation or journaling.</p>

<p>He recommends meditation (focusing on the breath) for logical people. That’s the only way to clean the perceptions.</p>

<p>This problem is also something I learned about people with high conscientiousness.  They tend to tear themselves apart psychologically trying to find what caused the problem so that it won’t repeat. And it’s hard on them</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="peace" /><category term="non-technical" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes from HealthyGamerGG podcast.

It specifically mentioned security vulnerabilities in these dependencies to be an important reason to upgrade.</p>

<p>Many times these security bugs do not affect us. For example, suppose a dependency is vulnerable to authentication jacking, and you have set up your system such that only trusted systems can talk to your internal server.</p>

<p>You may skip fixing this issue because it does not affect you. My rationale is to think in terms of: This does not affect you ‘yet’.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: If a dependency is vulnerable upgrade it anyway. It’s faster to upgrade a dependency than rationalize if we need to upgrade or not.</li>
  <li><strong>Easier Management</strong>: It’s easier to manage too. There are no vulnerable dependencies. Regardless of if they affect us or not.</li>
  <li><strong>Future Vulnerabilities</strong>: The most important rationale I have is we don’t know how the system will evolve. Maybe currently we are deploying in a secure zone but in the future, we may change it and that change could open us up to bugs we haven’t fixed yet.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, just fix it. It takes 10 minutes to upgrade to a minor patch.</p>

<p>Check if the upgrade is available, and upgrade it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Karma karo fall ki chinta maat karo</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a previous post, I talked about <a href="https://www.ankushchoubey.com/v1/karma-karmafal/" title="‌">Karma and Karmafal</a>. Here is why you should always keep your karma ledger clean despite to inability to control Karmafal.</p>

<h2 id="two-outcomes-of-karma">Two Outcomes of Karma</h2>

<p>There are two outcomes of karma</p>

<ol>
  <li>Karma bites us in our ass.</li>
  <li>Karma “may” supports us when we least expect it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="karma-debt-bites-us-in-our-ass-always">Karma Debt bites us in our ass always</h2>

<p>We think we can get away with things. This could be bigger things like cheating in an exam, corruption, or lying. Or this could be something small and trivial like, procrastinating, not helping someone in need, etc. We may miss something important like forgetting to set an alarm in the morning.</p>

<p>Karma Debt bites our ass always.</p>

<h3 id="loud-bite">Loud Bite</h3>

<p>Suppose we treat our friends badly. They initially try to understand us. But then they realize we are just bullies. Eventually, either we get into a fight or our friends leave us and we are left lonely. This is karma in full action. Loud, seen, and understood.</p>

<h3 id="silent-toll">Silent Toll</h3>

<p>The bite of Karma need not be loud. It can be a silent toll.</p>

<p>‌</p>

<p>Since childhood, I neglected learning maths. Sometimes I was overconfident in my ability. But overall because I didn’t practice, I couldn’t get to good college. Not only that I’m still weak at most maths places. I didn’t learn and overcome it. Math is a very important skill. And I predict I could have earned twice as much by being in a better college if I had spent my years learning. It’s a silent toll.</p>

<h2 id="karma-may-supports-us-when-we-least-expect-it">Karma “may” supports us when we least expect it</h2>

<h3 id="direct-support">Direct Support</h3>

<p>We may believe we don’t know enough. But if we trained ourselves (karma), when it comes time to perform, our bodies and mind act automatically. This is karma is action.</p>

<p>If you didn’t perform a crime, you are free from it.</p>

<h3 id="silent-and-slow-support">Silent and Slow Support</h3>

<p>Similarly, let’s say you showed told the truth at every moment. Now, you have built trust with the people around you. You have developed trustworthy friends slowly. That trust is because of your Karma.</p>

<h2 id="how-and-why-do-we-the-people-give-up-karma">How and why do we (the people) give up Karma?</h2>

<h3 id="believing-you-can-get-away">Believing you can get away</h3>

<p>You can’t get away with anything. Our world is a reality. Do you really think you could get away with one exam cheating? Try it. And then you’ll realize that you don’t know the concepts. And it compounds everything you do.</p>

<h3 id="avoiding-responsibility">Avoiding responsibility</h3>

<p>People try to find flaws around them to latch on to so that they can justify what they will be doing and what they did. It’s like taking revenge on the environment.</p>

<p>We argue for your rights. People are saying “We want a job”, What’s their qualification? They may have barely passed high school.</p>

<h2 id="karma-ledge-why-you-should-always-keep-it-clean">Karma Ledge: Why you should always keep it clean</h2>

<p>The Karma Ledger never lies. Karma Ledger keeps track of your inputs and your efforts. It’s the source of truth that no one can deny.</p>

<p>I am usually not someone who gives Ethos examples. But I have found a few people who keep their ledger so clean that it’s really hard to argue or find flaws in them.</p>

<p>These people are honest and forthright, say what they think, and get work done. From these people, I learned that no matter what, don’t make a single known mistake i.e. no mistake made from negligence.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jordan Peterson</li>
  <li>Narendra Modi</li>
  <li>Yogi Adityanath</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several benefits this offers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When you look back you have a stack of karma you see progress. This motivated you further.</li>
  <li>Every item is hopefully done to its best. You know you couldn’t have done more than your best. Meaning this moment is the best it can be.</li>
  <li>You have no karma debt. No getting your ass bitten.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keeping your karma ledger clean should be enough to do good actions.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="responsibility" /><category term="non-technical" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We should not avoid good action.

We are protected again from the ups and downs of life. As we grow old, this protection is lifted.</p>

<p>For some people this protection continues, therefore we see 40 y.o who have not grown up. But most grow up in maturity sooner.</p>

<p>There are many tragedies, nature (like death) and unnatural (like malevolence, betrayal, etc.) that are in our path. All these demands from us to be better than we are.</p>

<p>We need something to offset the tragedies of life. We need to live by a set of principles and actions that can help us mitigate most of these tragedies and manage what remains to the best of our ability. And then we also need to enjoy what remains and this must be prioritized.</p>

<p>And here’s the optimistic part, the principles we set up and the core values we choose and act on do set many things that couldn’t have been set in order otherwise. i.e. you reap the benefits of setting those core values in the long term.</p>

<p>In the short term, it may be tempting to take a shortcut. In the long term, however, you’ll be the strongest version of yourself.</p>

<p>The honest action you did today, however small, is towards that path. The room you cleaned voluntarily, you voted towards becoming responsible, again setting you on the same path.</p>

<p>Don’t deviate from the path. Walk. One foot after the other. Act. One action after the other and you’ll set yourself to be <strong>freer</strong>.</p>

Now the bugs you do get are all data bugs. Or configuration bugs.</p>

<p>Data Bugs can be solved with TDD, just validate all the data that comes into the system. <a href="/pre-save-data-validation">I have an article about it.</a></p>

<p>The other type of bug is a <strong>configuration bug</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: You have connected to a service that does not exist yet.</p>

<p>You can run the below types of analyzers in your continuous integration <strong>before merging</strong>. You can combine this with validation when the app starts. The app should fail to start if the validation fails.</p>

<h2 id="static-analysers">Static analysers</h2>

<p>You can find many linters and resources that can help validate static files.</p>

<p>You can also use static analysis tools to validate if your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yaml</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">properties</code> is structured properly.</p>

<p>Static analysers like Sonar can also be useful.</p>

<p>For example: Helm has a linter which can be used by the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helm lint</code></p>

<p>Here are some more:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://learnk8s.io/validating-kubernetes-yaml" title="‌">Validating Kubernetes YAML for best practice and policies</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint" title="‌">Dockerfile Linter</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dry-run">Dry run</h2>

<p>Many systems allow for doing a dry run. A dry run is where you list down everything that would happen during deployment. This would also show any errors that can come up during deployment.</p>

<p>For example: You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helm install &lt;chart&gt; --dry-run</code> to simulate how the execution would happen. If there are any perceived failures, it would be reported.</p>

<h2 id="making-custom-analysers">Making custom analysers</h2>

<p>To make a validation, this of all the ways validation can fail. Then add custom validations that could easily detect these errors. This can be done via the application itself</p>

<h3 id="validating-with-custom-scripts-use-this-for-multiple-applications">Validating with custom scripts (use this for multiple applications)</h3>

<p>Here are some ideas that can be easily implemented with some Python scripts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are deploying to Kubernetes, before your merge, validate if the image actually exists.</li>
  <li>If you have URLs in your properties files, make sure those URLs are active.</li>
  <li>If a certain field needs to be base64. verify that it is actually base64 or not.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="validating-within-the-application-for-app-specific-validations">Validating within the application (for app-specific validations)</h3>

<p>If you have a Spring Boot, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@ConfigurationProperties</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Validated</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javax</code> validations.</p>

<p>If you are using ENV files in a NodeJs application, you can manually add in a code to validate the config and throw an error if it exists.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="testing" /><category term="devops" /><category term="configuration-management" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[With TDD, you don't find any logical bugs.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The blog post may seem trivial to many readers. This could be because they haven’t faced a big loss in their life. The kind of loss this post talks about is achievement related. It’s not related to the loss of human life.</p>

<p>Many of us have experienced loss, this could be a loss of job or a sudden end of a relationship. And these can devastate us in the short term. This can be especially true if we work really really hard. We put in all our efforts and still, we lost.</p>

<p>There are a few approaches we take when facing a major loss.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Conjure up a story that keeps us away from reality.</li>
  <li>Examine, experience and accept reality as it is.</li>
</ol>

<p>In Julia Galef’s Scott Mindset, a book about clear thinking, she describes these approaches in a chapter on Coping Mechanisms. This article is an expansion to the original ideas of the book for experiences and accepting reality as it is.</p>

<p>The premise of this post is this: <strong>You can deal with failure better when you understand certain truths. <em>Understand, not just know.</em></strong> And by better I mean you can bounce back faster.</p>

<p>There is also the topic of how you not repeat the same mistake gain. But that’s for another time.</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-loss-truthfully">Dealing with loss truthfully</h2>

<p>Understand and internalize these truths.</p>

<h2 id="settling-the-past">Settling the past</h2>

<h3 id="truth-1-karmafal-is-not-in-your-hands-only-karma-is">Truth #1: Karmafal is not in your hands. Only karma is</h3>

<p>We don’t control the outcome of our actions. We only control how we act. There are many factors outside of our control. We can influence them with our decisions. But we can’t control them directly.</p>

<h3 id="truth-2-it-doesnt-matter-if-you-win-or-lose-it-matters-how-you-play">Truth #2: It doesn’t matter if you win or lose, it matters how? you play</h3>

<p>Life is a series of games. If you cheat and win one game, it doesn’t mean you can cheat and win another. But if you lost the first game and didn’t cheat but kept improving and playing, you’ll eventually win a lot of upcoming games that come.</p>

<p>Therefore, it doesn’t matter if you win or lose. What matters is how you played.</p>

<h3 id="truth-3-you-can-only-do-your-best">Truth #3: You can only do your best</h3>

<p>Here’s a hypothesis: Can you do more than your best <strong>at a moment</strong>? For example, at a certain moment, you learned a certain knowledge and hold certain resources, but you don’t know what’s beyond that knowledge. Therefore, you could only do your best.</p>

<p>That does bet the question of did you give your best. But as long as you did give your best, it doesn’t matter. Cuz you couldn’t have done more than your best.</p>

<h3 id="truth-4-you-cant-win-all-the-time-its-a-simple-probability">Truth #4: You can’t win all the time. It’s a simple probability</h3>

<p>What were your chances of scoring 99th percentile?? 1/99 assuming you have studied hard and studied better than all the people who also studied.</p>

<p>We always have wins and losses. These are mixed across time.</p>

<h2 id="looking-at-the-future">Looking at the future</h2>

<h3 id="truth-5-will-this-matter-in-3-5-years">Truth #5: Will this matter in 3-5 years</h3>

<p>Almost all loss or win doesn’t matter in 3-5 years. We change our trajectory so much that we don’t care in the long term.</p>

<h3 id="truth-6-the-past-is-gone">Truth #6: The past is gone</h3>

<p>No matter how much we may want to change the past, it’s impossible. The only thing we can do is learn from it and use those lessons to shape our future. Accepting this truth can be freeing and allow us to focus on the present and future.</p>

<h3 id="truth-7-the-next-chance-is-still-here">Truth #7: The next chance is still here</h3>

<p>There is always another chance. Life is long enough to get important things done, and even if we fail at something today, we can try again tomorrow or pursue a different path.</p>

<h3 id="truth-8-losing-means-learning">Truth #8: Losing means learning</h3>

<p>We have time, and now we also have experience. This means the next time we are less likely to make the same mistake if we learn it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="peace" /><category term="non-technical" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instead of seeing failure as a personal flaw or a permanent setback, see it as an opportunity for growth and improvement.

People around you should be able to guess your core values. Even without you explicitly telling them.</p>

<p>If they aren’t able to guess with a good degree of accuracy, you may have a branding issue or more likely you aren’t living to your core values fully.</p>

<p>At the same time, discussing your core values with others especially giving reasoning when you take certain decisions that others find weird is a good way to deepen your understanding and let others find holes in your values.</p>

<p>Explaining my core values to my friends and family has helped them understand me. And it has helped me be a more genuine version of myself.</p>

They aren’t short term.</p>

<p>They may have good shorterm impact too. But not always.</p>

<p>While you are following your core values, you’ll find people taking shortcuts. Hacking and bending reality to fit their short term purpose.</p>

<p>Many time you’ll also be tempted to go on the same path. To not pay attention to details. To skip consciously. You may want the same fast pace progress that other’s are having.</p>

<p>But don’t go down that path. Fast is an illusion. A puffed up reality.</p>

<p>Real long term progress is slow and takes months and years. You’ll likely stare into an abyss. But it’s way better to voluntarily choose to go and stare into the abyss. As more snd more time passed, you’ll see a light. A transformed version of you in every area of life.</p>

<p>So making your decisions based on what the world is doing. Let them take their path. You choose yours.</p>

<p>If you have carefully selected your core values, you believe these are your best bets. Choose your best bets no matter the short term impact.</p>
