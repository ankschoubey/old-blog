I have made this mistake a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent too much time planning and too much time deciding the perfect strategy which often took months to come up and then either never implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later I found out that the hard way was much shorter and would often take me just a few hours or at max a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an analogy in programming which says that a programmer will spend six hours automating something that takes six minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If something is repeated so every frequently then the six minutes saving in time is justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for most things, it is better to move on fast and break things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/move.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/move.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">First Hackathon</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/first_hackethon/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First Hackathon" /><published>2020-10-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/first-hackethon</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/first_hackethon/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/first_hackethon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to participate in one but I was afraid that my skills are not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But FTER working as a programmer for the last two years,  I realized that almost everyone starts with no skill and figure out a solution eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my goal for joining was to learn as much as I can. I knew I could do at least something even if not at a level I would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some lessons I learned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goal-is-not-working-software&quot;&gt;Goal is not working software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for the organizers was not complete working software. The goal was to see how the problem can be tackled from different points of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;team&quot;&gt;Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team could have been better organized. We almost wasted 2 weeks out of 5. In the second week, I tried taking up leadership, arranging meetings, and talking to people. But the by 3rd week my “leadership”  declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for the decline was that I was managing another full-time project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers were supportive. Plus we had access to AWS Experts. So we could ask them questions on specific issues we were facing with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;experimentation&quot;&gt;Experimentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many teams played it safe. They stuck to what they already knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We experimented. We tried things we did not know before. Though we did not win the challenge, this experimentation increased our learning and the likeliness that we’ll be better prepared for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/first_hackethon.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/first_hackethon.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Software project never ends</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/software_end/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Software project never ends" /><published>2020-10-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/software-end</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/software_end/">&lt;p&gt;Building software is having no fixed deadline. Below are some reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-vs-physical-products&quot;&gt;Software vs Physical Products&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software products are hard to wrap the head around when compared to physical products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A physical product occupies physical space which of course software does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a physical product is made, unless it is designed for modification, it cannot be modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software can be modified and improved at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-always-something-to-do&quot;&gt;There is always something to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look for problems to solve, you’re sure to find something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimize code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean code up and make ready for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it can be hard at times to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;over-engineering&quot;&gt;Over Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something can be built easily but we spend a lot of time deciding what the future thing might be and then we over-engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been guilty too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-reason-to-stop&quot;&gt;The reason to stop.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is said that in any software product around 70% of features are not used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many software themselves are not used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time spent fixing this trivial non-existent problem can be spent fixing some other big problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-intuitions-and-definition-of-done&quot;&gt;Human Intuitions and Definition of Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans can find ways to improve everything. Our judgment is not objective. We need something objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a strong definition of done can help be objective.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Building software is having no fixed deadline.

Instead, wishing to work for themselves or not to work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some benefits of working at an office that are hard to replicate otherwise are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-circle&quot;&gt;Social Circle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to keep office friendships shallow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a lifetime, we make more friends at the office than from school and college combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include people from many different backgrounds and age groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-opportunities&quot;&gt;Learning opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-ups in the office want people to take up more responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A win-win is when there is something you want to do or learn that can help solve a business problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is ask!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike school, you can pick and choose a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;experimentation&quot;&gt;Experimentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office also provides opportunities to experiment. Try new things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these things are planned within a team and for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: Proposing a new product idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hierarchy&quot;&gt;Hierarchy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools have a hierarchy of authority organized by age: Teachers over the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most offices resist age-wise authority. They tend to favor ideas and a person’s past deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unstructured time is hard to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The office provides a well-balanced structure for most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meaning&quot;&gt;Meaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work provides meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing that gives more satisfaction than knowing that customers like your product.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">For many, working 9-5 often is considered non-ideal.

&lt;p&gt;The process for finding the answer is more important so that they can replicate the process later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over-dependence is a  bottleneck. Always providing ready-made solutions seems to turn people weak and dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is your responsibility &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to make them capable of themselves finding the answers and making informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, everyone is free to work on problems that truly matter to them. The once that only they can solve. Allowing people to work in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great companies are structured such that the star entrepreneur/performer can leave the company at any moment. The company will still run just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These terms get biased by people’s past and their current thought processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of these as levels but it’s always hierarchical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rich for someone is being able to afford a house.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rich for someone else is being a billionaire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions like “How to be rich?” are very different for both of those paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Happiness can mean just having basic needs fulfilled or can mean pure excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-other-things-than-getting-defined-vaguely-are&quot;&gt;Some other things than getting defined vaguely are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modernity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secularism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suffering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good/Bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-communicators&quot;&gt;Good Communicators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noticed a quality of good communicators when they explain a term&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They listen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then try to understand exactly what the person is trying to say. They’ll ask questions if they have not understood properly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If they have to convey, they convey the exact information at the level that the person can understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways they do it is by using the right vocabulary words while keeping things understandable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There are many terms that are not hardcore logic.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Who is your audience?</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/audience/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Who is your audience?" /><published>2020-10-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/audience</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/audience/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/audience.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once was a participant in the Dance group at my school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were performing on for Children’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started our performance with LMFAO Party Anthem (English). It was a tough dance which we had practiced many times. We had also casually added Chamak Chalo (Hindi) to increase our performance length.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When LMFAO ended, we were all tired but there was no applause or appreciation from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a tune rang and everyone started cheering. Chamak Chalo was starting and the audience when bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The students at the school listened to Hindi songs. We were forcing English songs on a different demographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when “performing”, I try to keep this in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had an opportunity to play Piano at an office event. I had decided to play classical as that would best show my skills. But my audience had probably never given much thought to Vivaldi or Beethoven. So I picked a Perfect by Ed Sheeran. It was an easy song. But the audience loved more than I had expected.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Photo by Wan San Yip on Unsplash</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/audience.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/audience.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Correlation between Deep Learning Concepts and Philosophy</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/dl_lessons/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Correlation between Deep Learning Concepts and Philosophy" /><published>2020-10-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/life-lessons-learned-from-deep-learning</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/dl_lessons/">&lt;p&gt;DL = Deep Learning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NN = Neural Network&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P = Phisolophy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gradient-descent&quot;&gt;Gradient descent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DL: Optimization algorithm used for training NN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P: You can reach the place you want one step, in the right direction, at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keep-weights-small&quot;&gt;Keep weights small&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DL: Helps NN learn new data faster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P: Keep your identity small so that you can adjust easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;local-and-global-minima&quot;&gt;Local and Global Minima&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DL: Local Minima means your NN has learned something but it is not optimal. We always aim for Global Minima.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P: Your views and opinions are not perfect. They are probably just your perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;randomize-weights&quot;&gt;Randomize Weights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DL: Helps you explore the landscape and avoids getting stuck in local minima.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exponentially-weighted-average&quot;&gt;Exponentially Weighted Average&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DL: A type of average where more weightage is given to past numbers than latest number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P: Do you change your path completely if one outcome goes wrong? What about the last n outcomes that were right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;metrics&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DL: Used to check how well a NN has trained. Further training will be adjusted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P: Use metrics to see what’s working and not working. Adjust plans accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;test-data-and-testing&quot;&gt;Test Data and Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DL: Tests NN on unseen data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overfitting&quot;&gt;Overfitting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DL: NN memorized only certain things completely and cannot variations of unseen things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud has recently excited me more than anything else in the world. Consider this a fanboy rant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I was avoiding the cloud because it seemed very hard. But like every computer science buzzword, it is much much easier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I started learning AWS. These are a few things that have changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cost-pay-only-for-what-you-use&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;/strong&gt;: Pay only for what you use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud is anyway cheaper than building and maintaining your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost can be optimized further by setting up things properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cost is impacted by decisions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay per minute&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Different cost for different configuration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay per GB of data stored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And cloud vendors themselves provide options and encourage customers to optimize their usage to reduce cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rapid-availability&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Availability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources are available to you the instant you want them and in the location, you want them at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to start a Deep Learning project, on my local machine, it would take a full workday to just set things upright. Plus, you’ll have to deal with upgrades and maintenance yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same thing I wanted to do on AWS, it took just 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-hardware&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Hardware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fields like Machine Learning, you need high computation and specialized hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cloud provider can provide it instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Quantum Programming is a new field for programmers that were not available to most developers. But cloud providers are providing infrastructure for this new field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;choice-well-provide-infrastructure-your-code&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choice&lt;/strong&gt;: “We’ll provide infrastructure. Your code!”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, if you buy hardware and it is not used, you cannot do much other than selling the hardware to reclaim the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud solves this problem by allowing users to change their underlying infrastructure at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maintainance-well-provide-support-you-code&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintainance&lt;/strong&gt;: “We’ll provide support. You code!”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small things like replication of the servers and databases, scaling, sharding, maintaining security, etc are automatically taken care of with a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud vendors provide a good set of defaults and out of the box solutions to these common problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstraction-easier-than-traditional-setup&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstraction&lt;/strong&gt;: Easier than Traditional Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud vendors make it easier to use the cloud. Things are abstracted and one can choose to learn until what is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most normal developers would not have to deal with specifics of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-apis-code-less&quot;&gt;Special APIs: Code less&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all cloud providers provide special APIs for things like text recognition, image recognition, and even blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One need not be an expert to use these out of the box solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-cloud-is-a-win-win&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Cloud is a Win-Win&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud provides a lot of consumer surplus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud is such that the price of owning and maintaining for the individual user than if they would have built a server themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While for the cloud provider, it is also cheap because they provide it at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mentions, they are easier to use and provide the flexibility of choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/cloud.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/cloud.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Communication Bottleneck in large organizations</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/communication_bottleneck/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Communication Bottleneck in large organizations" /><published>2020-10-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/communication-bottleneck</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/communication_bottleneck/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/communication_bottleneck.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;productivity-increase-with-regards-to-extra-hires&quot;&gt;Productivity increase with regards to extra hires&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A smaller company sees an immediate boost in productivity just by the addition of a few extra employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demand increases, the company keeps hiring and increasing its employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after a certain point, the increase is the number of employees does not increase as much as it used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overhead-of-having-many-employees&quot;&gt;Overhead of having many employees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the number of employees increases, the communication overhead increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It becomes harder to align these increased employees to company policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, a separate department/role is to develop whose job is to check if employees following guidelines. (More Hiring)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;having-a-communication-policy&quot;&gt;Having a Communication Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of message hops it takes to replay information is very high, especially from lower-level employees to a top-level executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time spent in relaying communication is the time that can be spent working on the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why having a good communication policy is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communication-policy&quot;&gt;Communication Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus should be on reducing as many human middlemen as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-reduce-the-number-of-people-involved-in-accessing-information&quot;&gt;To reduce the number of people involved in accessing information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These help employees find the information themselves first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proper Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recorded Lectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple FAQ/Wiki page is a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focused-meeting&quot;&gt;Focused meeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meetings are usually justified regardless of whether the meeting is focused or whether people involved in the meeting are related to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somethings that always make meetings more productive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having an Agenda&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Timeboxing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having a limited number of people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contacting-policy&quot;&gt;Contacting Policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t need information fast. Rather most expect clarity in 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Who to contact for what sort of information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By when are they expected to get a response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;faster-lanes-for-getting-feedbacks-and-suggestions&quot;&gt;Faster lanes for getting feedbacks and suggestions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In larger companies, it becomes difficult to find problems on an individual employee level. An employee may have a really good suggestion/idea. This type of feedbacks should reach the right people as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having open to all suggestions/feedbacks forms is a kind of faster late to make this possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/communication_bottleneck.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/communication_bottleneck.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
