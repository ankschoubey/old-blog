<h2 id="what-is-the-75-hard-challenge">What is the 75 Hard Challenge?</h2>

<p><img src="/images/v1-75-hard/75-hard.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>75 Hard Challenge is a mental toughness challenge designed to toughen you up beyond the point you are now. It was created by Andy Frisella. And many people around the world participate in the challenge.</p>

<p>I have seen many Instagram Reels where people document their days of 75 Hard.</p>

<p>The Challenge has the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For 75 days,
    <ul>
      <li>Work out twice a day for 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>At least one workout outside (even if it’s rainy or sunny).</li>
      <li>Workouts cannot be back to back.</li>
      <li>Read 10 pages of a non-fiction self-help or entrepreneurial
 book.</li>
      <li>Diet</li>
      <li>No alcohol or cheat day</li>
      <li>Take a progress picture every day.</li>
      <li>Drink 1 Gallon (3.7 liters) of pure (no mixing anything) water.
If you fail any step, you have to reset your counter to zero and try again.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge can be scaled and has some customizability. For example, you can do any diet as long as it is healthy, and you can do any workout as long as it’s a good workout.</p>

<p>The challenge is not supposed to be something you plan to do. It’s something you just do.</p>

<p>Many people confuse 75 Hard with a physical fitness challenge. But it is not a physical fitness challenge. It’s a mental toughness challenge that has some good physical side effects.</p>

<p>To learn more about the 75 Hard Challenge, I recommend listening to Andy Fresilla’s Podcast on it. I listened to it on the first few days of the morning walk. 75 Hard is part 1 of 4 part Live Hard challenge, which is for a year.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-i-pick-up-the-75-hard-challenge">Why did I pick up the 75 Hard Challenge?</h2>

<p>I had constant feelings of having no purpose in life. I felt like I was just living my life, and days were passing. The excitement for the future wasn’t there. Add to it, I wasn’t able to take steps towards moving on from a heartbreak. Combine this with stress-related IBS, which is painful every day.</p>

<p>After talking to a friend about all this, I asked him what I should do when I have no purpose. He suggested I become a Warrior in a Garden.</p>

<p>I have always felt like a warrior born at the wrong time. But the Warrior in a Garden fit the mental model I was looking for.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s better to be a warrior in a garden than to be a gardener in a war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be prepared and ready and do your best always. Another quote that I relate to is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those who know how to use a sword but keep them sheth will inherit the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both the conversation with my friend Akshay and the quote helped me towards the path of searching for which “heavy” load I could find.</p>

<p>I thought, “I am already depressed. Might as well push myself and see what I can do. It won’t be as worse anyways.”</p>

<p><img src="/images/v1-75-hard/more-burpees.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then I remembered 75 Hard and Project 50. I searched both up, and I thought 75 Hard was better. So, I learned about it and got the printout to track.</p>

<p>75 Hard wasn’t the first time I was pushing myself. I had pushed myself 2 years ago, too, when I used to work out every day and plan and get work done. I listened to Jocko, and he had a high impact on me. Before the 75 Hard Challenge, I was confident that I would be able to complete it.</p>

<p>Between the last time, I pushed myself and 75 Hard, I had always been good at setting up “systems.” I had read atomic habits and was good at making my environment such that it would help me towards the task I was aiming at. But my systems kept failing; I needed what was there two years ago—a driver of all the system. I needed Discipline.</p>

<p><img src="/images/v1-75-hard/super-saiy.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="how-i-adapted-to-the-principles-of-75-hard-and-made-it-a-habit">How I adapted to the principles of 75 Hard and made it a habit?</h2>

<h3 id="starting-out">Starting out</h3>

<p>I printed out the 75 Hard PDF. I did not mess with Apps because I wanted to rely less on my phone.
<a href="https://www.docdroid.net/50XW1Br/75-hard-tracker-pdf" title="smartCard-inline">https://www.docdroid.net/50XW1Br/75-hard-tracker-pdf</a></p>

<p>I declared to my family that I would be starting the challenge. I showed them the PDF. The diet was a big concern. I could not cook myself because I won’t have enough time. So, I opted for going for online Delivery instead.</p>

<p>My family had been very supportive. I had told the reason why I was doing the challenge. “I want to get out of depression.”</p>

<p>I had allocated “funds” from my salary, and I calculated that I would be spending 16,000 Rs per month. For many, 16,000 on food is a lot. I viewed it as an investment. If I invest 16,000 here, I’ll get a lot more back. It was a winning investment with low risk.</p>

<h3 id="modifying-a-rule">Modifying a rule</h3>

<p>I have been sober my entire life. So I modified the No alcohol rule to be no YouTube. I gave myself one day to set up all the blockers for not watching YouTube.</p>

<h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>

<p>Over the coming days, I ate the following, and these stuck through the 75 days.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Morning: Order Eggs and Omelet. Later I ordered Paneer Bhurji.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>Afternoon: I ordered Chicken Salad.</li>
</ol>

      <figcaption>Lunch 2</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>Evening:
    <ul>
      <li>I ordered Gym Packer Protein which was multiple high-protein items in one order.</li>
      <li>I combined this with Curd, which the doctor said would be good for my IBS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Later in the challenge, around Day 40, I started to make Paneer Bhurji at home. It was fast, and I have now become good at making Paneer Bhurji.</p>

      <figcaption>A Palio Dinner I made by boiling.</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>If I could not eat or didn’t just feel like it, I would not eat at all.
If I was outside with my friends, I would either eat salad or not eat at all.</p>

<p>Fasting is good for health.</p>

<h3 id="drinking-1-gallon-of-water">Drinking 1 Gallon of Water</h3>

<ol>
  <li>I drank 1 liter when I woke up.</li>
  <li>2nd liter after coming from my morning walk, which was my morning workout.</li>
  <li>I drank 3rd liter of water while working out at the gym.</li>
  <li>And the 700 ml of water after the workout.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I missed drinking a few liters, I would chuck it before bed. This did mean I would wake up frequently at night, but it was part of the challenge, so it had to be done, and I didn’t regret it.</p>

<p>I also started setting reminders and wallpaper to remember to drink water.</p>

<p>Later, I started drinking more 3rd liters of water in the afternoon. So, during the workout, I would finish the last 700ml. This was because I reduced the need to chuck water at night.</p>

<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>

<p><img src="/images/v1-75-hard/goku.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>I opted for a morning outdoor walk and evening Gym.</p>

<p>The morning walk was initially just a walk, but later I ran for many days. I didn’t face rain during the challenge, but I faced it after it. It’s fun to walk in the rain.</p>

<p>I would go for a walk at any time, after waking up or in the afternoon. It didn’t matter if it was hot outside or not. I would just go.</p>

<figure>
  
    <img loading="lazy" class="docimage" src="/images/v1-75-hard/walk.png" alt="" style="max-width: 500px" />
    
    
      <figcaption>A typical walking day.</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Later, I work up earlier, at 7:30 AM, and start going. I would do my Daily Scrum stand-up while on the walk. But later, I felt it became stressful to walk while thinking about work, so I woke up even earlier at 6:30. To wake up early, I had to sleep early, but this time wasn’t fixed. If I couldn’t wake up early, I would still go for a walk at any time.</p>

<p>While on the walk, I would listen to podcasts. Initially, it was a podcast about 75 Hard, Jordan Peterson’s advice on becoming tougher, The Jocko Podcast, etc. This primed my mindset to the challenge more and more.</p>

<p>Many days when I was feeling overwhelmed, I did not listen to anything and just walked while “listening” to my mind.</p>

<video width="720" height="720" src="/images/v1-75-hard/pull-ups.mp4" controls=""></video>

<p>The evening gym was a group session at Cult.fit Fitness Center, which is near my home. I mostly did weights. I would do Yoga and Dance only if I wasn’t able to do weights.</p>

<p>I went mostly at 7 PM but later went at 6 PM.</p>

<p>On days when I had to travel, I would go for a walk early at 6 AM and go to the gym late at 7 PM or 8 PM. I had to only do once/twice because most of the time, I prioritized gym and the 75 Hard challenge over all other activities.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<p>I used to read for 20 minutes every day a few years ago. I always pick up non-fiction books that are related to areas that would help me. I read the following books.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Discipline Equals Freedom
    <ul>
      <li>Since I started 75 Hard, I thought this was the best book I could read.</li>
      <li>I learned a lot about the mindset and the thought process of being more disciplined.</li>
      <li>I used the lessons of the book throughout the challenge and still use them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ego is the Enemy
    <ul>
      <li>I was thinking between choosing the Dichotomy of Leadership and Ego is the Enemy, but I went with Ego is the Enemy because I thought I still had to improve before preaching to others.</li>
      <li>It’s a book that I thought was only about Ego. But it turned out to be about Humility and Discipline.</li>
      <li>This was a really good next book to Discipline Equals Freedom and Humility is what makes us pursue Discipline.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Anxious Hearts Guide
    <ul>
      <li>I would not have read The Anxious Heart, but Ego is the Enemy had taught me about Humility.</li>
      <li>I was suffering from Anxious Attachment Style, and I still have anxious tendencies; I knew this was a big problem.</li>
      <li>The problem with reading and learning is that I open up Pandora’s box of pain. But it was, and for me, it still is something I wanted to deal with. So I started reading.</li>
      <li>I learned a lot about why I failed, why heartbreak happened, and what I can do to improve. And I’m grateful to the author who wrote the book.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The shortness of life
    <ul>
      <li>Made me more focused and aware.</li>
      <li>I am in love with chapter 3. The tranquility of the mind.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Scrum Guide
    <ul>
      <li>I became the scrum master for our team for two weeks, and I thought I would have to coach the time.</li>
      <li>I also started implementing Scrum in my own life. So, reading the scrum guide would be perfect.</li>
      <li>It was just 10 pages, so I finished it in 1 day.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Scrum Handbook.
    <ul>
      <li>I had 6 days left in the challenge, and I wanted to read technical books after the challenge.</li>
      <li>So, I found the Scrum Handbook PDF, which was 66 pages. 66/6 is equal to 6 days of reading.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The books I chose and the podcasts I listened to while walking were related to the challenges I was facing. So these kept me focused and learning and improving at what I was doing day to day. i.e., the lessons became practice as soon as I read them.</p>

<h3 id="daily-photo">Daily Photo</h3>

<p>I used the EveryDay app for capturing a daily photo. The app allows for clicking one photo a day in the same position as the previous time, and you get a nice video/gif export of all the photos.</p>

<p>Clicking photos was the most boring part of the 75 Hard Challenge. I can see some progress, but not all.</p>

<p>I took photos shirtless, but my thighs are not captured. The size of my thighs is much smaller than they were before.</p>

<p>I missed taking a photo on Day 69 of the 75 Hard. That does mean I failed 75 Hard and should start again, but I’ll override. Photos are not something as imp as eating healthy, never eating junk, exercising twice a day, drinking 1 gallon every day, and reading 10 min. Hope that explanation should be enough.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-results-of-the-75-hard-challenge">What are the results of the 75 Hard Challenge?</h2>

<p>Before 75 Hard,</p>

<ul>
  <li>I was mentally disturbed.</li>
  <li>Freezing for ourselves in one place, overthinking, and being anxious.</li>
  <li>Had low work productivity.</li>
  <li>Had stress-related pain from IBS.</li>
  <li>Had low to no motivation.
During the 75 Hard,</li>
  <li>I pushed myself to a point that I was able to handle.</li>
  <li>I workout out every day. At the start of the challenge, I as picking 7KG and 10Kgs arms. By the end of the challenge, I was able to pick 25 Kg per arm.
    <ul>
      <li>My deadlift went from around 30-40 kgs to 92 Kgs.</li>
      <li>My weight dropped from around 83 KGs to 73 Kg. 10 Kg was reduced.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I was reading 0 books and spent all my time on YouTube.
    <ul>
      <li>I watched 0 hours of youtube on its website. I did watch YouTube video when it was put up on TV or when it was necessary on a separate site.</li>
      <li>I read 3 books and 2 PDFs and retained and applied many of their lessons</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>My productivity was boosted.
    <ul>
      <li>By the time I became scrum master on day 70. I was ultra-productive. I’ll talk about the productivity hacks in a separate post.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>My IBS reduced and reduced beyond the point of recognition. This was thanks to the mostly palio-type food I was eating and lots of exercises I was doing.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have confidence restored and was now able to plan for the long term, which I wasn’t able to do while I was depressed.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the challenge, I started following Scrum in daily life, which increased my productivity and work ethic even further.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Andy Fresilla for creating the 75 Hard Challenge. The program helped me bounce back to my old self. Thank you, Sir!</p>

<h2 id="advice-for-people-considering-75-hard">Advice for people considering 75 Hard</h2>

<p>Here is my advice for those considering 75 Hard.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Do it</strong>. It’s fun!</li>
  <li><strong>Create systems that many it easier for you to do it.</strong> You could read Discipline Equals Freedom and Atomic Habits during the challenge.</li>
  <li><strong>Do it for mental toughness</strong>. I was able to chuck water at midnight because I was doing the challenge for mental toughness. Even pushing myself at the gym was part of my mental toughness. If I was doing it to become healthy, I would have been satisfied with simple signs of progress. But I ignored those signs of progress because I wasn’t doing it for health. I was doing it for my mind.</li>
  <li>Learn from the guy himself. <strong>Listen to Andy Fresilla’s podcast on 75 Hard</strong>.</li>
  <li>Regarding exercise, <strong>you won’t feel tired at all if you are eating a high-protein diet</strong>.</li>
  <li>And <strong>if you fail, look for the silver lining of progress</strong> as long as you are improving, you will get better.</li>
  <li><strong>Get your family and friends on your side.</strong> Don’t be shy to open up and explain to them why you are doing this challenge and why it’s important to you. My family thought I would give up after a few weeks, but later in the challenge, they supported me and motivated me to complete the challenge.</li>
</ul>

Building a programming language includes too many steps and it’ll be unfair of me to say I know all of it. Therefore, I have added many resources that I used at the end of this article.</p>

<p>We used a tool called Antlr that helped us skip some hard stages.</p>

<p>The following article describes;</p>

<ol>
  <li>What was built?</li>
  <li>How to build an expression language? What decisions did we take?</li>
  <li>Make it like Google Sheets Building Evaluation</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-was-built">What was built?</h2>

<p>My team recently created an expression language for rest APIs. The expression language would work like this.</p>

<p>If someone calls a REST API, they can send a query like this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/rest/v1/users?query=“$name==‘Ankush’ &amp; $age &gt;= 25”
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then they only would receive that particular data.</p>

<p>This same can be used for building formulas that can be used for excel like functionality.</p>

<p>For example, suppose your data model is called User and it consists of the following record</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="err">“firstName”:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">“Ankush”</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="err">“lastName”:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">“Choubey”</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can write an expression in a map form like</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="err">“fullName”:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">“concat($firstName</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">‘</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">‘</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">$lastName)”</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The result would be adding an additional field resulting in</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="err">“firstName”:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">“Ankush”</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="err">“lastName”:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">“Choubey”</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="err">“fullName”:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">“Ankush</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">Choubey”</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The expression language supports arithmetic operators, logical operators, functions, etc.</p>

<p>This article explains how we build the expression language.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-build-an-expression-language-what-decisions-did-we-take">How to build an expression language? What decisions did we take?</h2>

<p>Building your own programming language involves 5 steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tokenisation</li>
  <li>Lexical Analysis</li>
  <li>Semantic Analysis</li>
  <li>Compiling</li>
  <li>Execution</li>
</ol>

<p>Each language is made up of distinct items. For example, this could be keywords like if, else, for, functions, numbers, strings, etc. these are all tokens.</p>

<p>The Lexical analysis is a step that converts the stream of tokens into a parse tree.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomassetti.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/antlr4_parse_tree.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Semantic analysis means understanding what each node means.</p>

<p>For example, if someone is performing equals on an unequal datatype, it should fail, $firstName == 1 should result in an error because firstName is a string field.</p>

<p>Compiling is generating the machine-executable code.</p>

<p>We went for building a transpiler. A transpiler is a piece of code that converts one language to another language.</p>

<p>We went for a transpiler from our expression language to MongoDB Queries.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-built-it">How we built it?</h2>

<p>The compiler world has become pretty mature. There are many tools available that help you get more than halfway through without effort.</p>

<p>We settled on a tool called Antlr.</p>

<p>In Antlr, we can describe the grammar of our programming language and it would generate code that would automatically do the first two stages, tokenization and lexical analysis.</p>

<p>Antlr would also generate Abstract Classes and Interfaces that we can extend. So, we extended those Interfaces and built our transpiler.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to compare two strings.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>'string one' == 'string two'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You would write an Antlr grammar like the following</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>equality: value == value; #equality
value: [a-zA-z]+ #value
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Antlr would generate a Visitor interface and implementation which would be something like this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>type visitEquality(Expression.EqualityContext ctx);

type visitValue(Expression.ValueContext ctx);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then create a concrete implementation which would be something like this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>String visitEquality(Expression.EqualityContext ctx){
  String left = visit(ctx.children().get(0))
  String right = visit(ctx.children().get(0))
  return
}

String visitValue(Expression.ValueContext ctx){
  return ctx.getText();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Antlr provided tokenizer and we would parse that and send it to Visitors. The visitors would generate MongoDB Queries.</p>

<h2 id="making-it-like-excel-and-google-sheets-ie-building-evaluation">Making it like Excel and Google Sheets i.e. Building Evaluation</h2>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Spreadsheet.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Building evaluation was also easy. There were some edge cases that we took care of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Google Sheets allows for the conversion of data types</li>
  <li>One cell with a formula can refer to another cell</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="google-sheets-allows-for-the-conversion-of-data-types">Google Sheets allows for the conversion of data types</h3>

<p>In Google Sheets, if you have a string + number, the evaluation is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the string can be converted to a number then it would be converted to a number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'1'+1</code> is equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code></li>
  <li>If we have two strings still it would get converted to the number <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'1' + '1'</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code></li>
  <li>If any number cannot be converted to a string, we’ll throw an error.</li>
</ol>

<p>To achieve this functionality we converted all values passed to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> operator to numbers using MongoDB’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toDouble</code> method. For example,</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'1' + '2'</code> would become <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{$add: [toInt('1'), toInt('2')]}</code></p>

<p>We did similar to other functions we had, for example for concat we converted everything to String using MongoDB’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toString</code> method.</p>

<h3 id="one-cell-with-a-formula-can-refer-to-another-cell">One cell with a formula can refer to another cell</h3>

<p>Suppose we received multiple formulas where one formula refers to another, for example</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "formulaOne": "$field1 + 20",
  "formulaTwo": "$formulaOne + 40",
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Suppose in the database, the value of field <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$field1</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20</code>, then the evaluation output should be</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "field1": 20
  "formulaOne": 40,
  "formulaTwo": 80,
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also don’t want a race condition in formula. For example, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">field1</code> refers to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">field2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">field2</code> should not refer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">field1</code>.</p>

<p>So the following case is invalid</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "someFormula1": "$someFormula2 + 1",
  "someFormula2": "$someFormula1 + 2",
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To achieve both these, we did a tree walk.</p>

<p>We know what formula names are: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">["formulaOne", "formulaTwo"]</code> let’s set this to a variable</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">List</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">formulaFieldNames</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">formulasMap</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getKeys</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can do a DFS and resolve each formula, if the formula has another formula, we’ll substitute that formula.</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="err">void</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">dfsResolveFormulas(String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">currentFormulaField,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">String</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">currentFormulaValue,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">List&lt;String&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">formulas,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">Map&lt;String,String&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">originalMap,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">Map&lt;String,String&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">resolvedMap,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">List&lt;String&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">path)</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

  </span><span class="err">path.remove(currentFormulaField);</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following code achieves the following</p>

<p>Given these formulas</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "formulaOne": "$field1 + 20",
  "formulaTwo": "$formulaOne + 40",
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It would resolve them to</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "formulaOne": "$field1 + 20",
  "formulaTwo": "$field1 + 20 + 40",
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now no formulas depend on each other.</p>

<p>And in the case of race conditions, when we try to walk the tree, in the following example</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
  "someFormula1": "$someFormula2 + 1",
  "someFormula2": "$someFormula1 + 2",
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li>During the first walk, we would have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">someFormula1</code>. The path variable would be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">["someFormula1"]</code>.</li>
  <li>During the second walk, we would have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">someFormula2</code> added. The path variable would become <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">["someFormula1", "someFormula2"]</code>.</li>
  <li>Now again we would try to walk <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">someFormula1</code>. But as we see the path variable already contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">someFormula1</code> so we’ll throw an error.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="lessons">Lessons</h2>

<p>Building a programming language was easier than we initially thought. And it was a lot of fun. It was a developer checklist item that I needed because it boosted my confidence.</p>

<p>The compiler world is better difficult but for simpler use cases like ours, it was set with Open Source tools such as Antr.</p>

Logical problems are solved easily. The emotional problem is how we feel.</p>

<p>We seek books that tell us the same thing in a different way that eases how we feel. i.e. how we feel impacts us.</p>

<p><strong>We need a strong why to do things</strong>. And here may be some ways to ease your emotions to do it.</p>

<p>Below are a few mental patterns that can be used to “Make yourself Do it”. Treat these as thought experiments.</p>

<h2 id="thought-experiments">Thought Experiments</h2>

<h3 id="turn-off-your-brain-and-do-it">Turn off your brain. And do it</h3>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Humans are stronger than we things. We need to exercise our wills. The most useful advice I have found is just make yourself do it. Eventually, the reward is so large and obvious that you’ll do it anyways.</p>

<p>I’ll share something personal and long. I learned it from HealthyGamerGG.</p>

<p>You can’t logic your way out of depression.</p>

<h2 id="logical-people-get-depressed-more-and-more-strongly-than-rest">Logical people get depressed more and more strongly than rest</h2>

<p>In normal people depression in 9% of people. If you go to the top 2 percent of high IQ people, it is 36%.</p>

<p>Depression is like auto-immune dysfunction of the mind. It’s your brain turning against itself. The stronger your brain is, the worst it does when it turns against itself.</p>

<p>The more logical someone is, the more they rely on logic to get through. So they have underdevelopment emotional intelligence and awareness.</p>

<p>If you ask them, they’ll describe very logical events. And all those logical events will be true. And since they are true, that makes it more of a reason for them to be depressed. But they won’t describe emotion. Cuz they aren’t in touch with it.</p>

<p>And when someone is emotional, it highjacks their logic. They can be logical and say they are logical. But their assumptions before logic can take place is itself hijacked. So, logic doesn’t work.</p>

<p>For example, a depressed person will more likely see the negatives than the positives.</p>

<p>Plus, smart depressed people have the habit of saying to themselves, “I should have had this figured out. But I haven’t had it figured out.” This creates shame.</p>

<h2 id="the-way-out-is-to-develop-emotional-awareness">The way out is to develop emotional awareness</h2>

<p>The way out of this is for the logical person to develop emotional awareness. To recognize what they are feeling and process the feeling independently of logic. To develop perspective.</p>

<p>It’s after they have processed their emotions independent of logic, that they feel a bit better and then they can use their logical brains i.e. when emotional one shouldn’t use their logic.</p>

<p>He also said that the processing of emotions can be crying too. After that, you can use logic. Or talking. Or meditation or journaling.</p>

<p>He recommends meditation (focusing on the breath) for logical people. That’s the only way to clean the perceptions.</p>

<hr />

<p>This problem is also something I learned about people with high conscientiousness.  They tend to tear themselves apart psychologically trying to find what caused the problem so that it won’t repeat. And it’s hard on them</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="peace" /><category term="non-technical" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes from HealthyGamerGG podcast.

It specifically mentioned security vulnerabilities in these dependencies to be an important reason to upgrade.</p>

<p>Many times these security bugs do not affect us. For example, suppose a dependency is vulnerable to authentication jacking, and you have set up your system such that only trusted systems can talk to your internal server.</p>

<p>You may skip fixing this issue because it does not affect you. My rationale is to think in terms of: This does not affect you ‘yet’.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: If a dependency is vulnerable upgrade it anyway. It’s faster to upgrade a dependency than rationalize if we need to upgrade or not.</li>
  <li><strong>Easier Management</strong>: It’s easier to manage too. There are no vulnerable dependencies. Regardless of if they affect us or not.</li>
  <li><strong>Future Vulnerabilities</strong>: The most important rationale I have is we don’t know how the system will evolve. Maybe currently we are deploying in a secure zone but in the future, we may change it and that change could open us up to bugs we haven’t fixed yet.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, just fix it. It takes 10 minutes to upgrade to a minor patch.</p>

<p>Check if the upgrade is available, and upgrade it.</p>

  <p>Karma karo fall ki chinta maat karo</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a previous post, I talked about <a href="https://www.ankushchoubey.com/v1/karma-karmafal/" title="‌">Karma and Karmafal</a>. Here is why you should always keep your karma ledger clean despite to inability to control Karmafal.</p>

<h2 id="two-outcomes-of-karma">Two Outcomes of Karma</h2>

<p>There are two outcomes of karma</p>

<ol>
  <li>Karma bites us in our ass.</li>
  <li>Karma “may” supports us when we least expect it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="karma-debt-bites-us-in-our-ass-always">Karma Debt bites us in our ass always</h2>

<p>We think we can get away with things. This could be bigger things like cheating in an exam, corruption, or lying. Or this could be something small and trivial like, procrastinating, not helping someone in need, etc. We may miss something important like forgetting to set an alarm in the morning.</p>

<p>Karma Debt bites our ass always.</p>

<h3 id="loud-bite">Loud Bite</h3>

<p>Suppose we treat our friends badly. They initially try to understand us. But then they realize we are just bullies. Eventually, either we get into a fight or our friends leave us and we are left lonely. This is karma in full action. Loud, seen, and understood.</p>

<h3 id="silent-toll">Silent Toll</h3>

<p>The bite of Karma need not be loud. It can be a silent toll.</p>

<p>‌</p>

<p>Since childhood, I neglected learning maths. Sometimes I was overconfident in my ability. But overall because I didn’t practice, I couldn’t get to good college. Not only that I’m still weak at most maths places. I didn’t learn and overcome it. Math is a very important skill. And I predict I could have earned twice as much by being in a better college if I had spent my years learning. It’s a silent toll.</p>

<h2 id="karma-may-supports-us-when-we-least-expect-it">Karma “may” supports us when we least expect it</h2>

<h3 id="direct-support">Direct Support</h3>

<p>We may believe we don’t know enough. But if we trained ourselves (karma), when it comes time to perform, our bodies and mind act automatically. This is karma is action.</p>

<p>If you didn’t perform a crime, you are free from it.</p>

<h3 id="silent-and-slow-support">Silent and Slow Support</h3>

<p>Similarly, let’s say you showed told the truth at every moment. Now, you have built trust with the people around you. You have developed trustworthy friends slowly. That trust is because of your Karma.</p>

<h2 id="how-and-why-do-we-the-people-give-up-karma">How and why do we (the people) give up Karma?</h2>

<h3 id="believing-you-can-get-away">Believing you can get away</h3>

<p>You can’t get away with anything. Our world is a reality. Do you really think you could get away with one exam cheating? Try it. And then you’ll realize that you don’t know the concepts. And it compounds everything you do.</p>

<h3 id="avoiding-responsibility">Avoiding responsibility</h3>

<p>People try to find flaws around them to latch on to so that they can justify what they will be doing and what they did. It’s like taking revenge on the environment.</p>

<p>We argue for your rights. People are saying “We want a job”, What’s their qualification? They may have barely passed high school.</p>

<h2 id="karma-ledge-why-you-should-always-keep-it-clean">Karma Ledge: Why you should always keep it clean</h2>

<p>The Karma Ledger never lies. Karma Ledger keeps track of your inputs and your efforts. It’s the source of truth that no one can deny.</p>

<p>I am usually not someone who gives Ethos examples. But I have found a few people who keep their ledger so clean that it’s really hard to argue or find flaws in them.</p>

<p>These people are honest and forthright, say what they think, and get work done. From these people, I learned that no matter what, don’t make a single known mistake i.e. no mistake made from negligence.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jordan Peterson</li>
  <li>Narendra Modi</li>
  <li>Yogi Adityanath</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several benefits this offers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When you look back you have a stack of karma you see progress. This motivated you further.</li>
  <li>Every item is hopefully done to its best. You know you couldn’t have done more than your best. Meaning this moment is the best it can be.</li>
  <li>You have no karma debt. No getting your ass bitten.</li>
</ol>

<p>Keeping your karma ledger clean should be enough to do good actions.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="responsibility" /><category term="non-technical" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We should not avoid good action.

We are protected again from the ups and downs of life. As we grow old, this protection is lifted.</p>

<p>For some people this protection continues, therefore we see 40 y.o who have not grown up. But most grow up in maturity sooner.</p>

<p>There are many tragedies, nature (like death) and unnatural (like malevolence, betrayal, etc.) that are in our path. All these demands from us to be better than we are.</p>

<p>We need something to offset the tragedies of life. We need to live by a set of principles and actions that can help us mitigate most of these tragedies and manage what remains to the best of our ability. And then we also need to enjoy what remains and this must be prioritized.</p>

<p>And here’s the optimistic part, the principles we set up and the core values we choose and act on do set many things that couldn’t have been set in order otherwise. i.e. you reap the benefits of setting those core values in the long term.</p>

<p>In the short term, it may be tempting to take a shortcut. In the long term, however, you’ll be the strongest version of yourself.</p>

<p>The honest action you did today, however small, is towards that path. The room you cleaned voluntarily, you voted towards becoming responsible, again setting you on the same path.</p>

<p>Don’t deviate from the path. Walk. One foot after the other. Act. One action after the other and you’ll set yourself to be <strong>freer</strong>.</p>

Now the bugs you do get are all data bugs. Or configuration bugs.</p>

<p>Data Bugs can be solved with TDD, just validate all the data that comes into the system. <a href="/pre-save-data-validation">I have an article about it.</a></p>

<p>The other type of bug is a <strong>configuration bug</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: You have connected to a service that does not exist yet.</p>

<p>You can run the below types of analyzers in your continuous integration <strong>before merging</strong>. You can combine this with validation when the app starts. The app should fail to start if the validation fails.</p>

<h2 id="static-analysers">Static analysers</h2>

<p>You can find many linters and resources that can help validate static files.</p>

<p>You can also use static analysis tools to validate if your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yaml</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">properties</code> is structured properly.</p>

<p>Static analysers like Sonar can also be useful.</p>

<p>For example: Helm has a linter which can be used by the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helm lint</code></p>

<p>Here are some more:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://learnk8s.io/validating-kubernetes-yaml" title="‌">Validating Kubernetes YAML for best practice and policies</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint" title="‌">Dockerfile Linter</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dry-run">Dry run</h2>

<p>Many systems allow for doing a dry run. A dry run is where you list down everything that would happen during deployment. This would also show any errors that can come up during deployment.</p>

<p>For example: You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helm install &lt;chart&gt; --dry-run</code> to simulate how the execution would happen. If there are any perceived failures, it would be reported.</p>

<h2 id="making-custom-analysers">Making custom analysers</h2>

<p>To make a validation, this of all the ways validation can fail. Then add custom validations that could easily detect these errors. This can be done via the application itself</p>

<h3 id="validating-with-custom-scripts-use-this-for-multiple-applications">Validating with custom scripts (use this for multiple applications)</h3>

<p>Here are some ideas that can be easily implemented with some Python scripts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are deploying to Kubernetes, before your merge, validate if the image actually exists.</li>
  <li>If you have URLs in your properties files, make sure those URLs are active.</li>
  <li>If a certain field needs to be base64. verify that it is actually base64 or not.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="validating-within-the-application-for-app-specific-validations">Validating within the application (for app-specific validations)</h3>

<p>If you have a Spring Boot, you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@ConfigurationProperties</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Validated</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javax</code> validations.</p>

<p>If you are using ENV files in a NodeJs application, you can manually add in a code to validate the config and throw an error if it exists.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="testing" /><category term="devops" /><category term="configuration-management" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[With TDD, you don't find any logical bugs.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The blog post may seem trivial to many readers. This could be because they haven’t faced a big loss in their life. The kind of loss this post talks about is achievement related. It’s not related to the loss of human life.</p>

<p>Many of us have experienced loss, this could be a loss of job or a sudden end of a relationship. And these can devastate us in the short term. This can be especially true if we work really really hard. We put in all our efforts and still, we lost.</p>

<p>There are a few approaches we take when facing a major loss.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Conjure up a story that keeps us away from reality.</li>
  <li>Examine, experience and accept reality as it is.</li>
</ol>

<p>In Julia Galef’s Scott Mindset, a book about clear thinking, she describes these approaches in a chapter on Coping Mechanisms. This article is an expansion to the original ideas of the book for experiences and accepting reality as it is.</p>

<p>The premise of this post is this: <strong>You can deal with failure better when you understand certain truths. <em>Understand, not just know.</em></strong> And by better I mean you can bounce back faster.</p>

<p>There is also the topic of how you not repeat the same mistake gain. But that’s for another time.</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-loss-truthfully">Dealing with loss truthfully</h2>

<p>Understand and internalize these truths.</p>

<h2 id="settling-the-past">Settling the past</h2>

<h3 id="truth-1-karmafal-is-not-in-your-hands-only-karma-is">Truth #1: Karmafal is not in your hands. Only karma is</h3>

<p>We don’t control the outcome of our actions. We only control how we act. There are many factors outside of our control. We can influence them with our decisions. But we can’t control them directly.</p>

<h3 id="truth-2-it-doesnt-matter-if-you-win-or-lose-it-matters-how-you-play">Truth #2: It doesn’t matter if you win or lose, it matters how? you play</h3>

<p>Life is a series of games. If you cheat and win one game, it doesn’t mean you can cheat and win another. But if you lost the first game and didn’t cheat but kept improving and playing, you’ll eventually win a lot of upcoming games that come.</p>

<p>Therefore, it doesn’t matter if you win or lose. What matters is how you played.</p>

<h3 id="truth-3-you-can-only-do-your-best">Truth #3: You can only do your best</h3>

<p>Here’s a hypothesis: Can you do more than your best <strong>at a moment</strong>? For example, at a certain moment, you learned a certain knowledge and hold certain resources, but you don’t know what’s beyond that knowledge. Therefore, you could only do your best.</p>

<p>That does bet the question of did you give your best. But as long as you did give your best, it doesn’t matter. Cuz you couldn’t have done more than your best.</p>

<h3 id="truth-4-you-cant-win-all-the-time-its-a-simple-probability">Truth #4: You can’t win all the time. It’s a simple probability</h3>

<p>What were your chances of scoring 99th percentile?? 1/99 assuming you have studied hard and studied better than all the people who also studied.</p>

<p>We always have wins and losses. These are mixed across time.</p>

<h2 id="looking-at-the-future">Looking at the future</h2>

<h3 id="truth-5-will-this-matter-in-3-5-years">Truth #5: Will this matter in 3-5 years</h3>

<p>Almost all loss or win doesn’t matter in 3-5 years. We change our trajectory so much that we don’t care in the long term.</p>

<h3 id="truth-6-the-past-is-gone">Truth #6: The past is gone</h3>

<p>No matter how much we may want to change the past, it’s impossible. The only thing we can do is learn from it and use those lessons to shape our future. Accepting this truth can be freeing and allow us to focus on the present and future.</p>

<h3 id="truth-7-the-next-chance-is-still-here">Truth #7: The next chance is still here</h3>

<p>There is always another chance. Life is long enough to get important things done, and even if we fail at something today, we can try again tomorrow or pursue a different path.</p>

<h3 id="truth-8-losing-means-learning">Truth #8: Losing means learning</h3>

<p>We have time, and now we also have experience. This means the next time we are less likely to make the same mistake if we learn it.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="peace" /><category term="non-technical" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instead of seeing failure as a personal flaw or a permanent setback, see it as an opportunity for growth and improvement.
