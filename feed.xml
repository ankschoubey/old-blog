<p>Many people agree with me that it’s a good thing to tell the truth.</p>

<p>But then comes parts where they start compromising telling the truth.</p>

<p>For example, they say I don’t want to hurt them so I won’t tell the truth there.</p>

<p>Or that “hinting” is same as telling the truth.</p>

<p>But truth isn’t something that you hide. Truth is actually not even something that you “say”.</p>

<p>It’s better to use a different vocabulary. State the truth.</p>

<p>We know that we don’t tell the facts. We state the facts.</p>

<p>Similarly, we state the truth. Meaning the truth passes through as it is.</p>

<p>For example, someone asks how we are doing?</p>

<p>Instead of saying I am doing really good. We say, I am better. If they drill down, I share what is really going on.</p>

<p>If someone asks why wasn’t this software delivery on time, I say, I haven’t been doing so well lately. Or that I haven’t been focused lately.</p>

<p>This is combined with honest action, to finish the work on time.</p>

<h2 id="a-recent-situation">A recent situation</h2>

<p>There is another situation I encountered. And it’s likely where many people are likely to lie.</p>

<p>I was in an Uber a few days ago. And the driver asked if he could take us offline. Offline means without the app. The driver would cancel the booking. And take us to the same destination without Uber. And I would have to pay him the same money. This way, the driver would not have his pay cut to Uber.</p>

<p>At the time, I did think Uber is a big company. But is it right to cheat against the big company. I thought let’s lie to Uber. I agreed to go offline. He canceled the booking and I snuck a deal to get 50 Rs. off the ride.</p>

<p>Pretty sweet. Now, the person who had booked the ride started getting calls from Uber. In the Uber app it showed that their is a cancelling fee of 38.10 Rs.</p>

<p>I thought Hmm. So, even after snugging a deal with the driver.</p>

<p>I got 11.90 Rs off if I add up the cancelling fee. That’s pretty bad.</p>

<p>The person who booked kept getting multiple calls from Uber to pay up.</p>

<p>Hmm. Uber help allowed selecting “My driver asked me to book without Uber”. I thought for a minute, what I should do. The person who had booked the Uber said that the Driver might lose his Job. I thought for a minute. And then decided I should side with the truth. I explained to the person that we should go with the truth and click the “My driver asked me to book without Uber” option. We did get out money back. 38Rs isn’t a big number. It’s about half a dollar.</p>

<p>Here why I choose “My driver asked me to book without Uber”.</p>

<p>The driver who did asked us for going offline, might also be convincing the same to other riders. And they maybe getting cancelling fees too.</p>

<p>Uber is a business built by hard working people. If they are providing a platform to earn, they should get the reward. The driver wouldn’t even have a job if Uber didn’t provide for it.</p>

<p>So, it didn’t make long term sense for the driver to try to betray his parent company.</p>

<p>If I side with the truth, the possibility that the driver no longer repeats the mistakes is created. It maybe possible that the driver chooses to still repeat the same mistakes. But at a minimum, he has an opportunity to choose a truthful path. And everything he does is truthful.</p>

<p>I also thought about how do court judges and people in administration do justice. Even though they know what is truth, they still may have humanly feeling to the person that may not have things in their favor. What should a judge do.</p>

<p>“We side with the truth”</p>

<p>Always. In every situation. No matter how big or small.</p>

<p>If I had told the truth with the intent of doing good. I would have explained the driver that the consequence of his actions. I should have denied his proposal. And that way, I would have given him a perspective that would have led him to a truthful path.</p>

<p>Since, customer is the king. Uber didn’t charge me anything. But it’s still weird to think that I was involved too.</p>

<p>For Uber the company, it costed 750 Rs. The money adds up to what they pay their employees. And everyone’s home runs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To me it costed 700Rs. That’s fine.</li>
  <li>To the person who booked the uber. It costed multiple phone calls.</li>
  <li>To the driver may costed his and his family’s earning.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="truth-with-truthful-action-passes-through-without-hurting-us">Truth with truthful action passes through without hurting us.</h2>

<p>If the driver had been truthful, he wouldn’t have had to face this situation. And neither would we.</p>

<p>If I had been truthful, both we and the driver wouldn’t have faced the situation.</p>

<p>Because truth passes through without hurting us.</p>

<p>Truth passes through can be imagined and us just standing and truth passing across us. If we are lying, we engage against truth, and it hurts us. If we don’t engage against the truth and let is pass, it doesn’t hurt us.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="non-technical" /><category term="truth" /><category term="mature" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why we should use the vocabulary 'stating'.

<p>Like rolling stones tell us, we can’t get all that we want. because there are limited resources so we have to make choices.
***</p>

<p>There are 3 types of resource according to Karl Marx.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Land</li>
  <li>Labor</li>
  <li>Capital</li>
</ul>

<p>And economic system allows for</p>

<ul>
  <li>What we produce?</li>
  <li>How we produce it?</li>
  <li>Who gets it?</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two types of Economy based on who controls the resources and what the system allows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Command Economy</li>
  <li>Free Market Economy</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Adam Smith said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not from the benevolance of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Command Economy is controlled by the government. It decides what to do.</p>

<p>Free Market Economy is where a companies decides what they can produce based on the profits they receive.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Invisible Hand</strong>: The unintended social benefit resulting from individual actions.</p>

<p>Free Market Economy leads to “invisible hand” where you as a result of paying for something that leads to profit good things happen.</p>

<p>For example, if 1 of 2 competing car brands make better products, they’ll have all the capital and incentives of the free market i.e. more profits. Thus to compete the other brand has to innovate. #invisibleHand</p>

<p>Similar is not the case with command economy. Government can make a car and have no competition but it doesn’t have any special need to innovate.</p>

<hr />

<p>Planned/Command Economy is not all bad. Because there are many things Free Market economy can’t handle.</p>

<p>Things like Security, Roads, Education, etc are all things needed for a good functioning free market economy but can only be provided via Government i.e. Command Economy.</p>

<p>Also, government intervine where Free Markets are failing. For example, it can provide regulation on car safety standards or how much pollution is allowed or how should the workers be paid. All of these, saves more money in the long run.</p>

<p>North Korea is a command economy. New Zealand is a free market economy with very few taxes. Most economies of the world are mixed.</p>

<p>And many economies are and have been changing. For example, Canada 🇨🇦 went from mostly free market to providing Universal Healthcare.</p>

<p>While, China 🇨🇳 went from mostly socialist economy to free market.</p>

<p>Modern economies are neither completely free or planned, there’s a spectrum of government involvement.</p>

<p>We should not fix ourselves to one ideology or another and rather focus on what get’s the job done at the time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white, if it caches mice, it is a good cat.
~ Deng Xiaoping</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>While we could absolutely abolish many things like poverty with a command economy, remember that in economic terms we always have trade-offs because we always have scares limited resources.</p>

<p>So, spending money to abolish poverty could lead to less money spend on health care or less money on security so a war that leads to more poverty!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="circular-flow-model">Circular Flow Model</h2>

<p>There is also a circle ⭕️ where</p>

<p>Indivuals Purchase from Businesses. This way business get’s money.</p>

<p>To purchase from business, individual need money.</p>

<p>so individually provide their labor to the business. So individuals now have money.</p>

<p>Government steps in between to provide facilities to both businesses and individuals. And to get their money they tax both individuals and businesses.</p>

Here’s another version of the same with respect to service.</p>

<p>A Service that handles tasks of a RestController isn’t very different from a rest controller.</p>

<p>We should separate out the Service from the Rest Controllers because we want to be able to re-use the service.</p>

<p>But if Service handles rest rest controller responses, it isn’t very different.</p>

<h2 id="an-ideal-service">An ideal service</h2>

<p>Here’s how you separate out connectors from the business logic.</p>

<p>Connector are mediums we use to communicate with the the outside world. Examples of connectors are Rest API connector (like RestController or RouterFunction+it’s Handler), Kafka Connector.</p>

<p>Services are code that implement the business logic.</p>

<p>All conversion from Entity to DTO or DTO to entity (i.e handle the request event and provide response in format needed by the client) should be handles at Rest API Connector.</p>

<p>The Rest API Connector is responsible for calling the service method between the request and the response.</p>

<p>For the service method, REST API connector is a downstream. So, it does not care about what format of data it sends. It’s just responsible for executing the business logic and sending the data in whatever is it’s format.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="web-development" /><category term="ddd" /><category term="clean-code" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your main business logic resides in your service.

<p>Adam Grant was the person who created the wealth of nations. He concluded that specialization and trading are better for everyone involved.</p>

<p>If you don’t specialize and trade, you’ll have to do everything yourself.</p>

<p>For example in the case of pizza, you’ll have to farm wheat, they make an oven and then even cook.</p>

<p>Instead, by specializing everyone’s opportunity cost improves.</p>

<p>The PPF profit possibility frontier helps understand the relationship between producing two products,</p>

<p>For example, if the us is producing 500 planes and it could use the same effort to produce 2000 shoes,
For every 1 plane they produce, they leave our 4 shoes.</p>

<p>If China can produce 100 planes or 800 shoes with the same effort, china for every 1 plane produced, leaves out 800 shoes.</p>

<p>It may seem that the US is better off here and should not trade, but if the US trades planes for shoes, they’ll be better off (need to learn here)</p>

<hr />

<p>Point outside the PPF curve is an impossibility
The point inside the PPF curve is inefficiency.
How do you maximize efficiency?
By specializing and trading.</p>

<hr />

<p>Self-sufficiency is inefficiency</p>

<hr />

<p>Wellness can be predicted by a variety of many economic predictors like GDP per capita, employee, and ent rate, by this we see statistically, most improvements came after Industrial Revolution.</p>

<p>We also see that countries that are voluntarily or involuntarily cut off from trading with other countries. like Iran Zimbabwe %</p>

<p>And countries like India and China that opened up the economy and started trading have been experiencing significant growth in %</p>

<p>Individuals and countries should specialize and do things that they have a competitive advantage in and then trade with others in what they have a competitive advantage in. This trade is mutually beneficial</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="crash-course" /><category term="econ" /><category term="summary" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Intro to Economics - Crash Course Econ 1</title><link href="https://www.ankushchoubey.com/crash-course/econ/1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Intro to Economics - Crash Course Econ 1" /><published>2023-03-04T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-03-04T14:42:15-06:00</updated><id>https://www.ankushchoubey.com/crash-course/econ/crash-course-econ-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.ankushchoubey.com/crash-course/econ/1"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ez10ADR_gM" alt="" /></p>

<p>Economics is not just a study of money or the stock exchange.</p>

<p>Economics is the study of people and their choices.</p>

<p>And this is based on two fundamental assumptions of Economics.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scarcity</li>
  <li>Opportunity Cost</li>
</ul>

<p>You could be doing one thing but you are choosing to do something else. In that sense, you believe that doing one is a better use of your time than another. Therefore, your opportunity cost of one is greater than another.</p>

<p>Scarcity means there is a limited supply of resources.</p>

<hr />

<p>Economics is when people make choices. When a college student decides to pick major A over Major B.</p>

<hr />

<p>Many people believe that if you just put more money into healthcare, it would improve. But in many cases what we need is the right incentive. So, economics is also a study of incentives.</p>

<p>For example, you could provide the college with an incentive on the number of enrollments. But then college would play it to just enroll.</p>

<p>Then you modify it to incentivize the number of graduates, then you suddenly have colleges just passing people or lowering difficulty or only admitting smart kids.</p>

<p>So, it’s very important to get incentives right. Because wrong incentives can backfire.</p>

<hr />

<p>Most economists are in Microeconomics. Whether to launch the business snow or later? What to do when a competitor does x?</p>

<p>Macro is the study of a Nation and its decisions like inflation, unemployment, etc.</p>

<hr />

<p>Both Governments and the Free Market support each other. One can’t function without the other.</p>

<hr />

<p>There is always an opportunity cost. If you don’t want road accidents, you could remove all cards from the road. But you understand the opportunity cost and decide one is better than the other.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="crash-course" /><category term="econ" /><category term="summary" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The only differences between external_apps and internal_features in a plugin architecture</title><link href="https://www.ankushchoubey.com/v1/internal-vs-external-plugin" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The only differences between external_apps and internal_features in a plugin architecture" /><published>2023-03-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-03-03T14:52:08-06:00</updated><id>https://www.ankushchoubey.com/v1/v1-difference-between-third-party-and-first-party</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.ankushchoubey.com/v1/internal-vs-external-plugin"><![CDATA[<h2 id="from-a-users-perspective">From A User’s Perspective</h2>

<p>First Party <strong>Default</strong> Apps are just product features.</p>

<p>First Party <strong>Installable</strong> Apps are apps that can be installed by the user.</p>

<ul>
  <li>These apps are not enabled by default</li>
  <li>These are provided by default.</li>
  <li>A user won’t even know that these are treated as an app by the platform company.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Third-party</strong> apps are created by third-party developers and can extend the core functionality of the first-party app.</p>

<ul>
  <li>These apps are not enabled by default.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="code-perspective">Code Perspective</h2>

<p><strong>These two types of apps are the same</strong>, except the first-party app doesn’t need Authentication to access Platform data, while the third-party app does.</p>

<p>A third-party app may utilize all capabilities that the plugin platform provides unless some capabilities are reserved for first-party apps.</p>

<p>In the previous post, I explained how we could define scopes for our resource would work.</p>

<p>I took the example of movies where an app is using 2 scopes: “<strong>read:movies</strong>” and “<strong>read:userinfo</strong>”</p>

<p>Let’s call this app, an external_app.</p>

<p>Now suppose we have an internal feature, which uses the same endpoints that “read:movies” and “read:userinfo” uses.</p>

<p>The only difference between external_app and the internal feature would be that the external_app will use OAuth and scopes to get access to the resource. While the internal_feature would not have to ask for permission to access the resource.</p>

<p>This means, once you create a scope, it’s fixed.</p>

<p>And this simplifies your development a lot.</p>

<hr />

<p>So, therefore, we need not treat internal features and external apps very differently.</p>

<p>At the platform level, both internal_feature and the external_app are just apps.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="architecture" /><category term="plugin" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[From A User’s Perspective]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Defining Scopes for your OAuth Service</title><link href="https://www.ankushchoubey.com/v1/oauth-scopes" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Defining Scopes for your OAuth Service" /><published>2023-03-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-01T14:52:08-06:00</updated><id>https://www.ankushchoubey.com/v1/v1-oauth-scopes</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.ankushchoubey.com/v1/oauth-scopes"><![CDATA[<p>Here’s my thinking on how we should design scopes for OAuth. And how many a proper REST API could simplify the process.</p>

<hr />

<p>In a rest API, we have resources. Our resources are usually accessed with just a noun.</p>

<p>so,</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/movies</code> to get all movies</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/movies/{movieId}</code> to get a specific movie</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PUT</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/movies</code> to modify a movie</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/movies</code> to add a new movie</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DELETE</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/movies/{movieID}</code> to delete a movie</p>

<hr />

<p>Our Outh scopes are a restriction on resources</p>

<p>so, we would have scopes for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">movies</code> resource.</p>

<p>We can append this with the kind of method that can be run on the resource.</p>

<hr />

<p>For example:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read:movies</code> -&gt; allows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> calls on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/movies</code> REST API resource</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write:movies</code> → allows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST</code> calls on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/movies</code> resource.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read:userinfo</code> → allows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> calls on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/userinfo</code> resource</p>

<hr />

<p>When the app is submitted to our “App Store“, the app developer declares an app, they are using a particular scope.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say an App that shows user recommendations has asked for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">read:movies</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write:movies and</code> read:userinfo<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> </code>.</p>

<p>The app developer has declared why they use each of the scopes. While declaring, they decide they aren’t using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write:movies</code> scope.</p>

<p>The same mechanism could be used to migrate multiple tables. And can be implemented in SQL stored procedure or stored procedure equivalent in the DB of your choice.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add these additional columns to your source table
    <ol>
      <li><strong>is_migrated</strong>: default false</li>
      <li><strong>migrated_date</strong></li>
      <li><strong>is_error</strong></li>
      <li><strong>error_description</strong></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Create a DB migration script which
    <ol>
      <li>Copies a batch of data from one table in source DB to one table in dB.</li>
      <li>The batch size could be 1000. You don’t want the batch size to be too small because it could be slow. You don’t want it too high to be able to recover better.</li>
      <li>Whenever a batch is a complete update the is_migrated and migrated_date in the source DB. Then pick up the next batch where is_migrated is false.</li>
      <li>If there is an error, set <strong>is_error</strong> to_ true _and add <strong>error_description</strong>.</li>
      <li>The <strong>error_description</strong> could be an exception that is thrown.</li>
      <li>Once the script is done, check for <strong>is_error: true</strong> and fix those errors in the script itself.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Running
    <ol>
      <li>Run the script by copying the data from PROD to your testing environment.</li>
      <li>Fix your scripts if you find <strong>is_error: true</strong></li>
      <li>Once all is fixed, re-copy data from PROD to your testing environment and run again.</li>
      <li>You want to make sure everything works perfectly so that you won’t have to do much during the PROD run.</li>
      <li>Once you find all bugs are fixed, run the migration script in <strong>PROD</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<h1 id="i-dont-and-wont-do-things-that-i-want">I don’t and won’t do things that I want.</h1>

<p>I will do and do do things that I need or things that need to be done.</p>

<p>Both are a form of responsibility. Need being respo to self. Need to be done means respo to others. Because my wants can always be something that’s not good for me. But my needs are always good for me because they are essential.</p>

<h1 id="i-wont-lie-i-wont-utter-a-word-that-i-know-is-a-lie">I won’t lie. I won’t utter a word that I know is a lie.</h1>

<p>And I won’t manipulate to get what I want. But I can state it simply.</p>

<p>Because I don’t know what the truth is. But atleast when I’m speaking I’ll stop and reformularw when i’m about to utter a lie so that i’ll be as truthful as possible.</p>

<p>On the same line. I won’t ever manipulate or lie to get what I want. But I’ll state them clearly as I can. And see if I can hget it. If I do get it via an ethical parh good. Or else I’ll try another day.</p>

<h1 id="i-dont-attack-the-person-i-attack-the-action">I don’t attack the person. I attack the action.</h1>

<p>I want toxicity and/or problem to end. It doesn’t help to attack the person because person gets defensive.</p>

<p>I need a better way to explain this. I can say I want toxicity to end or problem to end. But I need something more definitive.</p>

<h1 id="there-are-no-shortcuts-there-are-no-hacks">There are no shortcuts. There are no hacks.</h1>

<p>Shortcut is a lie. The hack does not get you anywhere.
I am not afraid to voice my opinion where it’s needed and necessary.
I am speak the truth. And I understand there are no shortcuts. And no hacks!</p>

<h1 id="i-dont-revolve-my-life-around-women">I don’t revolve my life around women.</h1>
<p>As a man, it’s tempting. And sometimes I feel insecure FOMO. But there are more important things to do in my life. I have responsibilities and I need to fulfil them!</p>

<p>Plus, it’s not like it helps. Having someone that you trust solves that area only. Not other areas! And if I try to burden someone, it’s not god for them, it’s not good for me. I do my part. And them do theres.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="philosophical" /><category term="for-future-me" /><category term="decision-making" /><category term="non-technical" /><category term="matured" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The fundamental operating system]]></summary></entry></feed>
