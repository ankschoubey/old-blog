Do it via email. If you had communication offline or via another medium that is not documented, send a mail stating the minutes of the meeting and agreement. If necessary ask for a confirmation reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think this is disrespectful as I had communication with the person offline but as humans, we all of us forget. The email is for your future and the receiver’s future self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case, if a person or company denies the deal you have a written “official” mail. He cannot repudiate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people and companies are normal but some are malevolent. You’ll thank your past self of the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To not look robotic, mention to the person that you’ll be dropping a mail mentioning these points and would require confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned this from my managers and my father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often argue on the point of companies should providing value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on one level, maybe one of the most important thing is all companies are there to make money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;providing-value-employee-pov&quot;&gt;Providing “Value”: Employee POV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providing value is often never well defined and there can be many ways to look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even employees working in a company getting a steady paycheck, raising a family, having health insurance for themselves and their family is a valuable thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every company is in an industry, geographic location or stage of growth where they can be good at everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;painful-part&quot;&gt;Painful part&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most painful part is when the company drops its employees. It usually does not happen because the company is evil. But because dropping employees is the lesser evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either you drop employees (and resources) or let the whole boat sink (with everyone in it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big world events like Pandemic or recession always remind us how important and valuable money is for companies and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Counter Argument&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;/facade/&quot;&gt;Facade Companies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These apply to companies which sell “premium”/high cost products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies try putting limited time offers making people decide to put money down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have fallen victim myself. Multiple times. Especially with gyms and education sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize they have limited time offers every other day. 😑 I could have waited before jumping to their sales presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many startup which are in hyper-growth stage do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;okay-for-middlemen&quot;&gt;Okay for middlemen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For middlemen companies such as shops and e-commerce sites. It matters less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are middlemen, they don’t care about the customers. They care about sales and money 💰.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-okay-when-you-are-selling-yourself&quot;&gt;Not okay when you are selling yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for companies which sell products themselves, they risk one every important factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when user does not like your product?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He was half sure about buying your product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now he will tell everyone in his connection to not purchase your product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plus he’ll also mention to them not to fall for your “sales presentation”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done so myself multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word of Mouth sale is quite underrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are here only for money, increasing valuation, getting more investors, getting sales by tactics such as selling themselves (coupons), brand, and social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when everything is all set, the founders will exit without hesitation. Not because the problem has been solved but because they didn’t care about solving the problem at all. It was just a facade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;programming&quot;&gt;“Programming”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job of a programmer is to think and then implement a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;strong&gt;better to not write for an hour&lt;/strong&gt; when you don’t have your thoughts organized in your mind than to write for hours and &lt;strong&gt;then spend all week trying to fix&lt;/strong&gt; and fiddle with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-process&quot;&gt;The process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When starting initially students are thought to write down the algorithm, make flowcharts, etc. and it is understandable that as you get more experience programming you may want to skip that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially if the problem is something you have already worked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t implement something without giving it thought. Take time to get your thoughts organized. You are not sitting in an exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-time-tracking-is-counter-productive&quot;&gt;Why time-tracking is counter-productive?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I say time-tracking is counter-productive is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Somedays you realize you have written a bunch of code and it works but works like crap but you cannot do better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then the next day you come back to it… it’s still ugly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some days later you realize that the work you have been doing for the past several days is already done in an Open Source Module.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And you discard whatever you had coded up to that point and start from scratch again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming requires a lot of “research” and thinking. Things that can be done (can be done better) away from a screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have made your software that might be part of it that might need change. Most changes are simple such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing the font&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changing colors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Somethings that work should work on specific environments or domains&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Features such as storage location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than hard coding everything, make these things configurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that can be changed with just a click of a button or by changing properties or via Database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small things such as these should not take any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if there is something that some thing which requires user preference, then give them the option to choose it themselves by making the configuration available to them via UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar: &lt;a href=&quot;/config/&quot;&gt;Programming is now Configuring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In one of the posts, I wrote previously I explain how programming has become configuration.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">When you are just starting out, don’t try to imitate the expert.</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/imitating_experts/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="When you are just starting out, don’t try to imitate the expert." /><published>2020-08-17T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-08-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/imitating-experts</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/imitating_experts/">&lt;p&gt;Imitate after you have a firm base to understand what and why they are doing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts have a hard time explaining things they have internalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to copy them at-least initially will likely lower your confidence and make you wanna skip and go home and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People on YouTube have a “perfect execution” and they usually don’t show how much work goes behind it. A way to look behind their work is to look at them performing Live or streaming Live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For programmers, it can be helpful to look at GitHub commits too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Similar but with a twist&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;/observe/&quot;&gt;Observe other people in action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Imitate after you have a firm base to understand what and why they are doing something.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Middleman</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/middlemen/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Middleman" /><published>2020-08-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-08-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/middlemen</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/middlemen/">&lt;p&gt;Middlemen companies provide services from one company to either another company or to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stripe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Car Dealers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile Wallets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food Delivery Services&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ride-Sharing Apps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most online e-commerce website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-business&quot;&gt;The Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason middlemen can operate is that the source company is too complex for most normal people or companies to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they make it convenient for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk&quot;&gt;Risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this also is risky if the source company can easily provide the facility themself. Then there is no need for a middleman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like when Tesla decided to not sell their cars through a dealership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middleman companies in a way act as an affiliate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The source company deals with creating the product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The middlemen deal with selling the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Middlemen companies provide services from one company to either another company or to consumers.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Support shows how much the company really care</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/support/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Support shows how much the company really care" /><published>2020-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-08-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/support</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/support/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/support/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overlooked-but-important&quot;&gt;Overlooked but important&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a part of a company which is I feel is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customers who come to support actually use your product and they care enough that they are not jumping switch to another app. Instead they are here to get their problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about pushing a product out, getting money, and then doing nothing. Care for your customers. Not just because they are paid for you and that they will likely continue to use your product … but because it a human thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-it-easy&quot;&gt;Make it easy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it easy for them to contact you as easily and as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They may want their problem solved quickly: call link&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maybe they don’t like talking: put chat link or support email up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Respond at least within 24 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the producers’ side, it also helps to have support costs low by providing FAQs, help guides, and improvements to the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-and-bad-customer-service&quot;&gt;Good and Bad Customer Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple &amp;amp; Tesla do wonderful customer service. Even Samsung when they recalled all their exploding Note 10s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find banks and telecom companies are bad at customer service. Heck, they even charge fees without much explanation. &lt;strong&gt;The reason customers remain is that jumping to another customer is a longer process&lt;/strong&gt;. They’ll probably jump when an easy transparent option is available (I’ll jump too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies which I had interaction with and have excellent customer support service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cure.fi&quot;&gt;Cure.Fit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wakingup.com/&quot;&gt;Waking Up App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dayoneapp.com/&quot;&gt;Day One App&lt;/a&gt; - These guys never disappoint&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swiggy.com/&quot;&gt;Swiggy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Most above ideas are probably a result of me watching YC Startup School.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
