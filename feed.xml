&lt;p&gt;You cannot build it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a fixed way of looking at the world. We see one problem from 1 point of view. 10 people can see 10 problems with a different point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we cannot expect to be right all the time. If we want smart people to be around us, we need to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And expect the best idea to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, it is easier to get work done in cross-functional teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something you may not like is liked by someone else. Your weakness can be covered up by someone’s strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can code the big picture but I miss out on the details. Usually, another team member catches them and corrects them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was bad at explaining myself in meetings early in my career. A senior used to back me up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similarly, I cover up for specific tasks for other members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advice I would give my past self when I joined work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Resist the urge to be a solitary wise man. Be a good neighbor instead. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;I stumbled upon this thinking about a tweet proposing that every startup should have at least 1 female co-founder.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;And thinking about the teams I work and have worked with. 🙂&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Either:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;think about writing a blog, in which case the blog is never written.
        &lt;ol&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;The idea is lost.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go back to Step 1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Next day or a few days later, wake up and see an awefully written post.&lt;/li&gt;

Observing people is second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When learning to do anything try to find someone who has already been doing that thing you want to do and observe them in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started learning deep learning and it was very intimidating at start but then I found a YouTube channel where she taught about deep learning and I got to see her developing deep learning projects. She did the same mistakes as me And spent most of the time googling stuff and fixing bugs. I learned more about how things happen in the actual job. I had been fantasizing before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I learn more about programming by watching other people program stop. And by reading other people’s code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learn more about how to create an attractive website by learning from smart passive income blog website Reviews which taught me how to set things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned more about management by watching my seniors and especially my client in a single meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always be in a position to look 👀 at how others do what you want to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It removed a lot of fear, myths, and makes you better by learning from other’s mistakes and methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biographies are also a path.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">While doing it yourself is the first step.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-outsource-everything&quot;&gt;Some outsource everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see a lot of carmakers just putting their brand over something. Like Suzuki which just puts in a logo on Maruti Ertica which is developed by Toyota. Some even put their brand on cosmetics which has nothing to do with cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or what a lot of Indian smartphone makers did. Micromax and Lava which just bought products from Oppo and put their logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years pass and original manufactures became so good at developing and marketing that they started to sell themself and took over the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-build-almost-everthing-themself&quot;&gt;Some build almost everthing themself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are companies like Tesla and SpaceX which build everything themself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They realized that building themself was not just cheaper but they could iterate fast and build better because it was custom made for themself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, not only they built better products but they develop a lot of Intellectual Assets, IPs, and Patents that their competitors could not replicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla builds it’s own software and CPUs for auto-pilot technology which rest are taking help from Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpaceX designs and builds everything on its own. While Boeing buys existing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple outsources production but still designs everything by itself. While rest rely heavily on Google for phone software and Microsoft for PC software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-companies-take-control-back&quot;&gt;Some companies take control back.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is taking back control of its microprocessors because it realized that it can ship better products if it designs the chips themself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is not something that they just decided to do overnight. It must have been planned for years and developed for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And still, the rolling out is a 2-year transition giving everyone enough room to adapt. And from what current iPads perform it can be assumed that these new computers will perform better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ofcourse-you-should-outsource-if-&quot;&gt;Ofcourse you should outsource if …&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large Hollywood studio need not worry about their backend software. It’s not their core business. Their business is making great movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hospital need not build it’s own hospital management software. Either they just buy it or outsource it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as discussed above there may be advantages to building it themself 🙃.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A lot of companies make the mistake of outsourcing what they are good at or what their core business is.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/tesla-gigafactory-4-europe.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/tesla-gigafactory-4-europe.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Just buy it.

This is the anti-Derek Sivers approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a product already exists, don’t build it yourself from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got excited by Rasberry Pi and Arduino boards a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought them all and built:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Smart” switchboard which I can control from my phone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A retro raspberry pi gaming setup with an old ps3 controller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building them was a little bit of work. I had to watch a lot of videos and google a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I connected Alexa so now I could control lights and fans with just my voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the problem was just wired and I had the replace them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a month for each but after building it I thought it was done. Complete finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a few weeks passed. Switch stopped working. The gaming console thing was decent but it stopped working too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both took a week each to fix. Finally, now it is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later it broke again. Then again after a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was especially inconvenient because my family was using the switch too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now raspberry is just lying in storage and one smart switch which family used was removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still had the switch in my room. I just had to fix it. It’s been 2 years. 😂 It is still there. And now I don’t want to fix it. So I am going to finally remove it from my wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why spent time building it yourself when you just purchase it. Especially hardware shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to develop using plain javascript when Angular or React can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to build a gaming computer from scratch when you can just buy a console and be done with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t try to “use Linux” where you’ll have to spend a lot of time setting everything perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, some people do it. But I would argue to only do it if it is your full-time job. Or it is something you have to and want to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t waste your time on problems that have already been solved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is the anti-Derek Sivers approach.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/2020-07-24-consumers-just-buy/1_switch.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/2020-07-24-consumers-just-buy/1_switch.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ideas</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/idea/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ideas" /><published>2020-07-08T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-07-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/ideas</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/idea/">&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;a href=&quot;/math&quot;&gt;Math motivation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/write&quot;&gt;Writing Motivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;importance&quot;&gt;Importance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good ideas are common and meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good execution is rare and therefore valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;originality&quot;&gt;Originality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No idea is truly original. Be flexible to adapt to new ones. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most ‘unique’ ideas fail. Successful once are spinoffs of already present ideas. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding&quot;&gt;Finding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of hyper-growth startups, ideas are counter-intuitive. If it seems sensible it is likely a bad idea. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most hyper-grown startup ideas don’t look like startup ideas at all. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to find a hyper-growth startup idea is a bad idea. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to find better ideas is to explore the world and know your customers. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think Big &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;Get started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to find the perfect idea, start small with the one you have and iterate. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baton Road &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a feeling I had since childhood about how humanity progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one individual changes the world. There is a generation of them. Making improvements big or small that effect and push everyone forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Someone made electricity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other person did maths&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some person made transistor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other made Integrated Circuit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People started making better software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hardware got faster&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internet happened&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smartphone’s happened&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deep Learning is happening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baton has been passed from generation to generation of thinkers who were no smarter than we are. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the baton is not held by an individual, it is held by a whole group of people, in my view, the current major baton holder is Mr. Musk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Musk is pushing a lot of critical areas forward. Our generation and the future once will not have to worry about a lot of problems because they will be already be solved by people like him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every moment happens once. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next Steve Jobs won’t start a hardware business.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next Zuckerberg won’t start a social network.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next Elon Musk won’t start an electric car company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The next one will have to deal with a new problem most relevant to that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday the 🔥 baton will pass on to our generation. Hopefully I’ll be ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;action-hobbies&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action&lt;/strong&gt;: Hobbies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hobbies are weird in the sense that after an initial interest in doing it we start expecting too much from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each next creation becomes a race to be better than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every-time you show something you cooked or something you made… the first reaction from people is… why don’t you open a business??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No! This is something I do for fun…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no real ROI! I don’t want to be famous or make money with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life requires activities that have no other purpose than the joy that activities itself provides.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If suddenly there is an expected ROI attached it has a probability of not being fun anymore. Though the &lt;strong&gt;result of having an expected ROI to a hobby is that the quality and quantity of output increase a lot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hobbies are an active process: The more effort that has been put in the higher is the reward. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consumption-books-media-and-games&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumption&lt;/strong&gt;: Books, Media, and Games&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that many consider being a waste of time is consumption. Often quotes float around which says something on the lines of Make your own life so exciting that you don’t need to consume anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one level this may be true but it is a little too extreme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is watching Silicon Valley a waste of time? Maybe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Did I get a boost of coding confidence ever since starting Silicon Valley? Hell yeah! ROI was higher.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Was watching One Piece a waste of time? No. I actually enjoyed it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Did I get my positivity pumped? Definitely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consumption only impacts the mindset of the consumer and does not result in direct action.
The tricky thing is that we don’t know what will get us inspired or changed perspective for the better. If we did knew it already, it would be pretty boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumption is a passive process: You don’t have to actively work at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;I actually don’t know how to write this without giving my personal anecdotes. So if you are a programmer explore this section in the DOM 😬.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;secret&quot;&gt;
I have been guilty of setting very high standards for people around me and for my behavior towards them too. It is not something I do consciously nor it is something I want to do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The people around me have always been supportive, caring and made me less bored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We are not dealing with creatures of logic. These are people just like me with emotions, ups/downs, discomforts, strengths, and weaknesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We are social animals made to support each other during the bad and the good. I was and am always available for my friends/family when a problem arose in their life and they need me. But I was never there to share happy moments with them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Dealing with people is both active and passive:&lt;br /&gt;
Active: To be there to be for them when a problem arose and they need.&lt;br /&gt;
Passive: To be there to share their happiness.&lt;br /&gt;

And since you are someone who took the effort to read this in DOM, I am really grateful. If we have, in some way lost touch just ping :)

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;word-of-mouth&quot;&gt;Word of Mouth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that there are more things in the world then technology products but for a lot of technology products I don’t like ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like cars. Tesla does it the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They make a really really good product which is much better that what is offered by the competition and thus the words spreads by word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the industry will mature I can understand that the gap between your product and the competition is very less. Thus in that state to win the market you essentially have to try everything like Advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marketing-money&quot;&gt;Marketing money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever heard of Beats by Dr. Dre. The product kind of sucked before they got bought off by Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their product money split was something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 percent marketing + beautiful cover
60 percent product&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for their survival was not that they had a good product. Bose was probably better in every way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason for their survival was every god damn music video used Beats in their video. Their packaging was too good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand Bose was profitable just for their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beats is not at the place it was in it’s hype years now. That is likely because Apple (it’s now parent company) has decided to focus more on product quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over marketing a product while ignoring quality mean you get the initial sales but they as time passes you have to deal with user start disliking you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programming initially included these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;variables&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;operators&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;conditionals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;loops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;functions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with these were concepts such as Algorithms and Data Structures. All these in effort to make original programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-we-do&quot;&gt;What we do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly I have realized that most of what we do is not creating functionality from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the kind of things I do regularly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wanted to add zoom in zoom out on images: &lt;strong&gt;OpenSeaDragon module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wanted to generate PDF on the client-side: &lt;strong&gt;jsPDF module&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wanted trailer videos: &lt;strong&gt;TheMovieDB API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Idle session timeout alert: &lt;strong&gt;ng-idle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Want to talk to a DB: &lt;strong&gt;Spring Data JPA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wanna have a table on a page: &lt;strong&gt;I don’t write my HTML tables. I use DevExpress&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Want my website to be installable on Mobile/Desktop: &lt;strong&gt;@angular/pwa&lt;/strong&gt; module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming role for the most part is to configure other’s code/modules/APIs so that it works well along with other modules and our tiny code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whatever tiny code that we do write is rarely even unique. For the most part, it is either the same functionality as something built before or copy/pasted from StackOverflow or Github.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also for a good amount of things, one can easily skip backend coding by using something like Firebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-generators-and-configuration-files&quot;&gt;Code Generators and Configuration Files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to contribute to PyTorch so I read their code and understood nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I had enough Python &amp;amp; DL skills but that was not the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point was they have ATEN: a kind of configuration language that allows them to generate programs in their target language on the Fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A topic similar to code generators are configuration files such a .properties or .yaml&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love these. The behavior of the application can be changed entirely using configuration files. For these to be most effective the entire application has to be built with configurability in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8020-split&quot;&gt;80/20 split&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to despise DevOps earlier because I never wanted to leave programming behind. After all, a major part of DevOps is configuring tools. But I realize now that ROI is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still believe that learning the principles are more important than learning a specific technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning a principle such as Deep Learning means that underlying technological tools such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, or even AutoML matter very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These principles (20%) apply to a small by very important parts (80%):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deciding what to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;connecting different modules&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;debugging&lt;/li&gt;
