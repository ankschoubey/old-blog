&lt;p&gt;Software Engineers solve problems by building solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We keep iterating on the solutions, make it better and eventually replace the solution with something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have efficient processes for managing projects and handling productivity. Even if a deadline is near, the solution is shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software developers ability to get so much done is because of the nature of software and focus on efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-problem-to-solve&quot;&gt;What problem to solve&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A non-technical person does not know the problem that can be solved using technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A technical person does not know what problems to solve. The result is that time is solved solving problems on trivial issues like social media instead of more important fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-other-fields-can-benefit&quot;&gt;How other fields can benefit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some fields have slow progress rate. There is a long delay in medical research getting to production (Approx 20 year &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). There hasn’t been much innovation in the field even in engineering fields like Civil engineer or biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is likely because these fields require physical products and take longer to build and test. A technology solution can help speed up some of their processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graphics Modelling and Simulations to speed to testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Organization and Retrieval Systems to make sure the right information is accessed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deep Learning Models to help search for replacing overdependence of specialized hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automation of manual tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to ensure these fields get benefits of innovations in computer technology is to work closely with experts in the field or to get into it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach works better because most software features never get used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you are a FANG company or even if you are, you should save your resources to focus on the area that matters most. Which you only understand after the feature is in the wild for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have made this mistake a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent too much time planning and too much time deciding the perfect strategy which often took months to come up and then either never implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later I found out that the hard way was much shorter and would often take me just a few hours or at max a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an analogy in programming which says that a programmer will spend six hours automating something that takes six minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If something is repeated so every frequently then the six minutes saving in time is justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for most things, it is better to move on fast and break things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/move.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/move.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Comparison in evaluation</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/comparison/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Comparison in evaluation" /><published>2020-11-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-11-03T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/comparison</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/comparison/">&lt;p&gt;While evaluation performance don’t compare one person to another&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see managers make this mistake a lot they compare one persons performance to another persons performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this may seem good for some things like giving an award to the best performer a better approach would be compare the person with his whole past performance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This not just gives everyone a fair chance but also is more accurate Level of judging improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in math system it would be like change in percentage rather than change in value. I’ll percentage growth instead of growth in value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s almost cannot be used as a way for new hires sense the person in charge know so little about them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">While evaluation performance don’t compare one person to another</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Age is not a perfect measure of experience</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/age/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Age is not a perfect measure of experience" /><published>2020-11-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-11-03T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/age</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/age/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/age.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kids-learn-too&quot;&gt;Kids learn too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some kids learn hard skills like playing the piano at a very young age. They often get labelled as a child prodigy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This categorization assumes that the child is born with talents and ignores the fact that he/she has to spend years learning the skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most child piano prodigies start at age 4, by the time they are age 10  they already have 6 years of Piano experience. No doubt they have skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-who-learn-faster&quot;&gt;People who learn faster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some people put in more effort to learn to skills properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They either grasp the ideas or maybe had better learning resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, they learned skill with no formal learning/training would take years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;argument&quot;&gt;Argument&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most corporate environments favour “years of experience spent at work” at a primary factor for determining salary and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ignores the ability of the person to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/age.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/age.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">First Hackathon</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/first_hackathon/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First Hackathon" /><published>2020-10-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/first-hackethon</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/first_hackathon/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/first_hackathon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to participate in one but I was afraid that my skills are not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after working as a programmer for the last two years,  I realized that almost everyone starts with no skill and figure out a solution eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my goal for joining was to learn as much as I can. I knew I could do at least something even if not at a level I would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some lessons I learned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goal-is-not-working-software&quot;&gt;Goal is not working software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for the organizers was not complete working software. The goal was to see how the problem can be tackled from different points of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;team&quot;&gt;Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team could have been better organized. We almost wasted 2 weeks out of 5. In the second week, I tried taking up leadership, arranging meetings, and talking to people. But the by 3rd week my “leadership”  declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for the decline was that I was managing another full-time project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers were supportive. Plus we had access to AWS Experts. So we could ask them questions on specific issues we were facing with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;experimentation&quot;&gt;Experimentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many teams played it safe. They stuck to what they already knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We experimented. We tried things we did not know before. Though we did not win the challenge, this experimentation increased our learning and the likeliness that we’ll be better prepared for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/first_hackathon.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/first_hackathon.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Software project never ends</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/software_end/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Software project never ends" /><published>2020-10-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/software-end</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/software_end/">&lt;p&gt;Building software is having no fixed deadline. Below are some reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-vs-physical-products&quot;&gt;Software vs Physical Products&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software products are hard to wrap the head around when compared to physical products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A physical product occupies physical space which of course software does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a physical product is made, unless it is designed for modification, it cannot be modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software can be modified and improved at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-always-something-to-do&quot;&gt;There is always something to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look for problems to solve, you’re sure to find something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimize code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean code up and make ready for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it can be hard at times to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;over-engineering&quot;&gt;Over Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something can be built easily but we spend a lot of time deciding what the future thing might be and then we over-engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been guilty too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-reason-to-stop&quot;&gt;The reason to stop.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is said that in any software product around 70% of features are not used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many software themselves are not used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time spent fixing this trivial non-existent problem can be spent fixing some other big problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-intuitions-and-definition-of-done&quot;&gt;Human Intuitions and Definition of Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans can find ways to improve everything. Our judgment is not objective. We need something objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a strong definition of done can help be objective.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Building software is having no fixed deadline. Below are some reasons why.</summary></entry></feed>
