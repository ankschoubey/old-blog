&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@conniwenningsimages?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Constantin Wenning&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/shake-hands?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two parts to communication: listening and speaking. And these roles change between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any communication any form, there is a some amount of context loss. But in some communication context loss is much higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because of the way sentences are phrased. Or how is someone is nervous communicating. Or what pre-assumptions someone has made which could and could not be due to lack of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be us. Or this could be the other person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t control how the other person understands. Not fully at-least. But we could try to present ourselves in a way that the other person feels more open to talk, express and communicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By choosing the right medium, listening better and articulating properly; one can reach close to 100% retention of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would help us reach an understanding faster. The best way to do it is to keep things light and to be calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;choose-the-right-medium&quot;&gt;Choose the right medium&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tone of voice, facial expressions, body language, etc provide useful information even if they aren’t studied explicitly. It’s what our social brains are adapt to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, cutting these features out of communication can be problematic in certain cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texting: Should not be used for emotional communication no matter how hard it feels. If it’s becoming hard, transition:Logistics 
Calls: Normal. Emotional. 
Video: Better
In Person: Best. Aim for in-person communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;listening&quot;&gt;Listening&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, the goal is to seek to understand, than to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;have-the-attitude-of-the-person-you-are-listening-to-is-important-and-worth-listening-to&quot;&gt;Have the attitude of: The person you are listening to is important and worth listening to.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having mutual respect leads to better understanding and less drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;listen-carefully-and-listen-everything&quot;&gt;Listen carefully and listen everything.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how silly on mundane something seems. It maybe of value to the other person. Don’t negate anything by saying it’s dumb. It may or maynot be dumb. Listen and ask followup questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;understand-the-problem-instead-of-giving-solution&quot;&gt;Understand the problem instead of giving solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often we try to suggest a solution to something that’s not even a problem. It’s like Hammer 🔨. Wack. And nothing works. Because it wasn’t supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is complex and their are nuances. Those nuances need to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn to emphathize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/team-work/empathy.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case of communication, we can’t be hundred precent certain or 0% certain. Therefore we have to range ourselves between 95% certain and 5% certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;calm-the-other-person&quot;&gt;Calm the other person&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it may happen that the person you are talking to has intense emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be anger, happiness, sadness. Or they might be too critical of themselves (Like someone you are reading 😇). In someway they have their guards up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1. Calm them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make them drink water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell them to calm down. And that way you can understand them a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-not-interrupt&quot;&gt;Do not interrupt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than interrupting, wait for when the person has stopped. Even if they are are saying something that you don’t agree with. Let them speak completely. This not only helps understand the other person better, this is more respectful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-present-your-arguments-early-on&quot;&gt;Don’t present your arguments early on.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes someone jump to a different tangium. Your goal is to understand their points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the person present his points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-wait-for-your-turn&quot;&gt;Don’t wait for your turn&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t wait for your turn to speak. When the person has stopped speaking, you could take a moment to think and then speak or ask followup questions. It isn’t akward to wait and then speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s not your respo to overly try to make a situation pleasant. Over trying makes situation more akward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;speaking&quot;&gt;Speaking&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;agree-to-what-you-find-right&quot;&gt;Agree to what you find right.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often someone interrupts us or are in a emotional state and are continuing to talk. Let them speak and then agree to the points you agree with. This helps establish a common base for further conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-dont-understand-something-re-iterate-what-the-person-is-saying-and-ask-if-its-right&quot;&gt;If you don’t understand something, re-iterate what the person is saying and ask if it’s right.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specially in complex or emotional issues, understanding someone is hard. Doing the aboves means that you’d have understood better and the person knows you have understood better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ask-neutral-questions&quot;&gt;Ask neutral questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specially on text messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand neutral questions it’s more effective to understand it’s alternative. Loaded questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A loaded question is where you already pick a side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loaded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My friend lied to me about having a job. What should I do in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neutral:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If someone lies about themselves? What should be done? Or how should one think about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove references. Keep everything third person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use phrases like how should one think about this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;think-before-you-say-and-stay-in-the-realm-of-truth&quot;&gt;Think before you say and stay in the realm of truth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be hard at times. But think before saying, pausing is okay. Telling that you need a moment is okay. Then stay in the realm of truth and say exactly how you think or feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look even dumber when we say something without actually knowing. Therefore if you don’t know something say that you don’t know and ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;express-and-explain-better&quot;&gt;Express and explain better&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point to or give examples specially about you feel. Slow down. Speak slower. Be congizent of your emotions. Are you feeling too high or too low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask properly and exactly what you want. Be ready to negotiate. Explain how it might benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure about something, ask clarifying question or ask them how you should think about something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-talking-give-the-choice-to-other-person&quot;&gt;When talking give the choice to other person&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of saying: I’ll come to your house this Sunday (uninvited)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say: Can I come to your house?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask instead of commanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-things-civilized&quot;&gt;Keep things civilized&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t want to cross someone’s boundary. It’s not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-attack-the-person&quot;&gt;Don’t attack the person&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is human. Attack the specific activity and explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has an ego. You too. And everyone is trying to figure things out with information they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;if-you-had-an-argument&quot;&gt;If you had an argument&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect with them later. Lighten the mood. Tell them sorry with parts you messed up or slipped. Try to reach understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things have to be automatic. It isn’t ideal to keep thinking about these. Pick on one area at a time to work on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="communication" /><category term="team-work" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/communication-during-conflict.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/communication-during-conflict.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">How to be more inviting</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/be-more-inviting/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to be more inviting" /><published>2022-06-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-14T15:52:08-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/be-more-inviting</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/be-more-inviting/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;make-yourself-available&quot;&gt;Make yourself available&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of hiding yourself. Be more open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes real world and digital world too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real World: Be open to going out, making plans and meeting people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitally: This includes but isn’t limited to setting your status as “Available” on Teams/Google Chat #postPandemicWorld&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;helpguide-people&quot;&gt;Help/Guide people&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help/Guide people who need it. The goal isn’t the get “praised”. The goal is solving of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on solving of problems and help everyone. Another positive of helping everyone is you don’t expect anything back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, keep track of your commitments. And then ping people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="1-1-communication" /><category term="team-work" /><category term="draft" /><summary type="html">Make yourself available</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Paper work is like DevOps</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/paper-work-devops/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Paper work is like DevOps" /><published>2022-06-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-12T15:52:08-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/paper-work-devops</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/paper-work-devops/">&lt;p&gt;I have never been fully able to get into the flow of DevOps. I always kept wondering why that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe I have a good enough hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding is fast. You just learn a bunch of patterns and implement solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevOps is slower to work on because it requires a bunch of configurations. Those configurations are very specific and have to work a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the actually “DevOps” command/configuration would be small but require a lot of pre-reading/experimentation. Once done, the result is huge but daily progress usually seems much slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feels very similar to paper work be it bank, government, etc. Paper work requires a bunch of skills similar to what’s needed with DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pre-planning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regular experimentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus it requires more stuff, going out to bank, government office. A huge drain for some specially if paired up with being a bit shy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway it needs to be done. So might as well get it done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal" /><summary type="html">I have never been fully able to get into the flow of DevOps.

&lt;h1 id=&quot;naivity&quot;&gt;Naivity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things we take for granted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Health because we’re young&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cheating in an exam because it seems easy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning a programming language syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe all these things are very simple and easy. Many of them truly are simple because they have been abstracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-happens-when-you-learn-about-a-topic&quot;&gt;What happens when you learn about a topic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once you know about a topic in detail and try to study it in detail you realize that there are a lot of intricacies and nuances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you learn more, your picture resolution for the domain increases and it seems to keep increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like a whole new world of something that you didn’t even realize existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some sense, you could say the truth keeps getting truer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been my recent experience with many things: testing, philosophy, and rationality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;it-makes-it-hard-to-go-back-to-a-simpler-version&quot;&gt;It makes it hard to go back to a simpler version&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience has been it’s very hard to switch to a normal model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Things I learned that made me truthful and more rational seem to destroy many of my friendships.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;At the same time reveals more of my flaws which I can’t un-see and would have to fix.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Things I learned about philosophy seem to make me weirder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Things  I learned about testing: well makes me want to test everything and despise code that hasn’t been written with TDD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;is-it-worth-the-cost&quot;&gt;Is it worth the cost?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure yet if all this is worth the cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each increase in fidelity seems to be making me disconnect from simpler life, having more friends, a fun existence, and normal life. In some sense, that fun existence is the opposite of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Naval says it’s possible to be both, learn truth deeply, and still be happy. or maybe it’s just that the grass is always greener on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="philosophical" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/truth-fidility.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/truth-fidility.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Running and Being Effective during Meetings</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/effective-meetings/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Running and Being Effective during Meetings" /><published>2022-06-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-06-19T15:52:08-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/effective-meetings</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/effective-meetings/">&lt;p&gt;A meeting is a place that can bring in new ideas and insights and save everyone’s time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore it’s very important to have an effective productive meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some ways to have effective meetings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;set-the-context&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set the context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most meetings aren’t as effective because the people involved don’t have the context behind what is being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be solved in a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agenda&lt;/strong&gt;: A few sets of outlines or questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide Pre-reading material&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A set of materials to read/watch before attending the meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It’s better to send a specific link than just mentioning the name of the topic.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set the context during a meeting&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Start the meeting by setting the context.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Why we are doing what we are doing?&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;What do we intend to get out of this meeting?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;be-prepared-early-by-maintaining-notes&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be prepared early by maintaining notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for the meeting yourself. You could create a google sheet (sheets.new) for each important recurring meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrospective meeting happens at the end of every sprint or every release. Since the release ended, everyone is already happy and have forgotten everything that they went through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, instead have a google sheet with your Retrospective format and fill in info there. So that you’ll have a set of useful points to add to the retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;encourage-discussion&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encourage Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round Robin Asking/Sharing Inputs&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Many people are shy and don’t speak up. To get everyone involved discuss concepts/questions in a round-robin fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You could even ask specific people who may be too silent “What do you think about this?”&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set time on the calendar&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It’s unproductive to wonder when the meeting is.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It’s best to have an exact date and time with the meeting link if it’s online (#postCovidWorld)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Meeting Durations&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Aim for 30 min meetings. Max 45.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The longer the meeting drags on, the more everyone will feel bored and start losing attention.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the meeting is dragging out longer, take a break. 10 minutes should be good enough.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;set-the-next-actions&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set the Next Actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the meeting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up time for the next meeting and putting it on the Calendar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an action list&lt;/strong&gt;. An MoM of sorts
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Discuss the outcomes of the meeting and have them written down along with who is accountable for it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means that if we know where to find the information, we won’t try to remember it. Instead, we’ll roughly know the location of where to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem nice at first. But here are some problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sense of the world/a topic, we need to keep our minds on info long enough to create meaningful connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won’t happen when we just know the reference and have to go read things over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the real world, the problems we face are usually of a repetitive nature this is because we haven’t taken the time to form the habits/strategies to cope with them. The more we can remember,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to make decisions. To make decisions fast and efficiently, we need to know, remember and recall hard facts on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By remembering we also save a lot of time in finding, re-reading, and coming to the same conclusions again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these make it important to memorize/remember things better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There is a cognitive bias called the Google Effect.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ways towards Freedom</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/freedom/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ways towards Freedom" /><published>2022-05-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-05-31T15:52:08-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/freedom</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/freedom/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-i-have-been-contemplating-freedom&quot;&gt;Why I have been contemplating freedom?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been contemplating this for a while. Defining my core values has been a step toward consciously choosing the kind of person I want to be given the ups and downs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason to have freedom is to be “free” (duh!). To be free to choose what one wants to do when one wants to do it. And do not be tied to anything in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-are-some-ways-to-achieve-freedom&quot;&gt;What are some ways to achieve freedom?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So given the premise of freedom above, I believe these are some known ways to have a little more freedom in life. All of these are mutually exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-does-money-help-achieve-freedom&quot;&gt;How does money help achieve freedom?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more money you have, the less you have to worry about a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could eat what you want, travel where you want, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not as important to have money. It’s more important to become the type of person that can make money. That would set you free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-does-commitment-lead-to-freedom&quot;&gt;How does commitment lead to freedom?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children are full of potential. They are something but aren’t anything in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Committing to something, be it values, a career choice, a relationship, etc gives you freedom from all the other choices that look green from the outside. They may or may not be greener but that’s a discussion for some other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By committing to something, you release the potential it brings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-does-detachment-lead-to-freedom&quot;&gt;How does detachment lead to freedom?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detachment means having emotions under control. We assign too much importance to our emotions. Emotions are indicators but aren’t absolute truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Detachment keeps your mental RAM free because you aren’t attached to the outcome. aka you just don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes you a much more rational person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;rationality-as-a-way-towards-freedom&quot;&gt;Rationality as a way towards freedom?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being aware of your cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and loaded language; lets you be free of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-does-discipline-lead-to-freedom&quot;&gt;How does discipline lead to freedom?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is the ultimate. If you are disciplined, the work gets done despite resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being disciplined doesn’t mean you have to be super serious. Being super serious does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;winning-the-game-to-become-free-of-it&quot;&gt;Winning the game to become free of it?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many games are one-time games. Like money, once you win the game of money, you’ll just have to spend a little bit of time maintaining it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you have a good “personal brand” that’s reputation and truth worthy, you win everything without much effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you win the game, you become free of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ending-notes&quot;&gt;Ending notes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freedom is a feeling. It may be that you are truly free but just don’t feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate freedom is freedom from the mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="philosophical" /><category term="exploration" /><summary type="html">Why I have been contemplating freedom?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Shadow Clone of Ideas</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/shadow-clones/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shadow Clone of Ideas" /><published>2022-05-29T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-05-29T15:52:08-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/shadow-clones</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/shadow-clones/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/shadow-clones.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow clone is a popular concept in Naruto where a person can clone themselves into multiples. Each clone can then go and do something and once that’s done, the clone disappears and the original person would retain the memory of the clone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The protagonist, Naruto, could make 1000s of clones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If making clones were that easy in real life, each one could be assigned a different important task which would lead to super high productivity. Since the clone knows each other super well, there would be almost no friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downsides multiply too. Each clone would have the same weaknesses. All have the same mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that but sometimes that is too much mental gymnastics on one person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have opted to make shadow clones anyways but since it isn’t possible (yet), the other best solution seems to be to increase productivity, make shadow clones of knowledge and build good teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that ideas (clones of knowledge) can evolve and be implemented separately. This brings out uniqueness and the process of collaborating itself would make things better. And it’s less effort on any one person.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="baton" /><category term="team-work" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/shadow-clones.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/shadow-clones.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Gist of Behavior Driven Development - BDD</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/bdd/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Gist of Behavior Driven Development - BDD" /><published>2022-05-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-05-23T15:52:08-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/bdd</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/bdd/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;starting-with-a-users-problem&quot;&gt;Starting with a User’s Problem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any product development, the primary task is to solve a user’s problem. So you should start with the user’s problem and discuss how it could be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might lead to interesting approaches that could help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically it’s not the best to bring people in a group to “brainstorm” because it mostly leads to one or two people dominating the conversation. It’s best to ask everyone to think about 3 points. And then go in a round-robin fashion discussing each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the problem is defined well and some solutions are agreed upon, one may start with defining features. Though typically, it’s better to validate the potential business and the solution before setting foot further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the solution is finalized, you can start defining specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-document-that-keeps-everyone-is-sync&quot;&gt;The document that keeps everyone is sync&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specification is a document that describes what features are to be built exactly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be a single source of direction. If something is in the spec file, it has to be built that way. If it’s not in the spec file, it should not be built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spec file keeps the entire organization in sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The product team uses it to finalize features.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The development team used to know what to work on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The QA team used to build tests around those features.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The marketing team uses it to decide how to best market.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The documentation team uses it to make documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The design team uses it to design the product.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new member of any team uses it to learn about the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a specification file, everyone is confused. No one person can know everything. And even if he does it creates a bottleneck and a single point of failure if the person decides to leave the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the spec file keeps so many people in sync, details for those specific teams should also be mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;creation-of-specifications&quot;&gt;Creation of Specifications&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of specifications is a collaborative process, involving different teams. Especially Product, Development, and QA. also known as the three amigos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in reality, it’s best not to start with collaboration, it’s best for a single person on the product team to write down specification files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because he/she knows the business better than others and typically has good communication. It’s likely not the best way to test the English skills of a developer or a tester ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A product person would likely write in simple business terms that are understandable to all stakeholders. And since he/she understands best, the initial draft spec file would be out faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, the 3 Amigos can be followed to get better clarification and add more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;too-many-directions&quot;&gt;Too many directions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A problem someone writing the spec file can face is too many branches. The team collaborates and discovers 10 different potential paths. It’s best to not travel all the paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the business and solution would have been validated, real validation happens when the user starts using the product. Therefore we should limit the number of features, and for that, it’s best not to even write details of features we think are possible or good to have. #focus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;executable-specs&quot;&gt;Executable Specs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern way of maintaining spec files is by using feature files like Gherkin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gherkin provides a way to bridge the gap between what’s in the spec file and what has been developed. This is done by writing automated tests. If the test passes, we know the feature has been developed and is working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;specifications-by-example&quot;&gt;Specifications by Example&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also leads us to the point of how to write better specifications. The standard practice is this, described by examples. An example is how a user would interact with the system we have built. Examples solve the ambiguity. The keyword scenario is an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than writing, a file of up to 25 MB can be uploaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can write as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario&lt;/strong&gt;: Disallow upload of files greater than 25 MB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given&lt;/strong&gt; I am on the file management page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; I upload a 26 MB file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then&lt;/strong&gt; the upload should fail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And&lt;/strong&gt; should not be visible in the files list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario&lt;/strong&gt;: Allow upload of file less than equal to 25 MB&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Given&lt;/strong&gt; I am on the file management page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When&lt;/strong&gt; I upload a 25 MB file&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then&lt;/strong&gt; the file should be uploaded&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And&lt;/strong&gt; visible within files list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore in the above case, two examples/scenarios were generated, the success and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;behavior-driven-development&quot;&gt;Behavior Driven Development&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other tips can make scenarios cleaner and more specific. The cleaner and more specific the scenarios are, the easier it will be for everyone to collaborate and build better products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole journey encompasses BDD. BDD isn’t as specific as Test-Driven Development. The scope of BDD is much much larger and encompasses the whole product lifecycle from defining problems and validating to development and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="product-development" /><category term="testing" /><category term="bdd" /><summary type="html">Starting with a User’s Problem</summary></entry></feed>
