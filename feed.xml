&lt;p&gt;Software Engineers solve problems by building solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We keep iterating on the solutions, make it better and eventually replace the solution with something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have efficient processes for managing projects and handling productivity. Even if a deadline is near, the solution is shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software developers ability to get so much done is because of the nature of software and focus on efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-problem-to-solve&quot;&gt;What problem to solve&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A non-technical person does not know the problem that can be solved using technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A technical person does not know what problems to solve. The result is that time is solved solving problems on trivial issues like social media instead of more important fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-other-fields-can-benefit&quot;&gt;How other fields can benefit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some fields have slow progress rate. There is a long delay in medical research getting to production (Approx 20 year &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). There hasn’t been much innovation in the field even in engineering fields like Civil engineer or biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is likely because these fields require physical products and take longer to build and test. A technology solution can help speed up some of their processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graphics Modelling and Simulations to speed to testing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data Organization and Retrieval Systems to make sure the right information is accessed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deep Learning Models to help search for replacing overdependence of specialized hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automation of manual tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to ensure these fields get benefits of innovations in computer technology is to work closely with experts in the field or to get into it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two approaches to building a new feature to existing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;approach-1-ship-with-all-sub-features-on-the-first-release&quot;&gt;Approach 1: Ship with all sub-features on the first release&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach works well when the feature is small or needs to be secret to gain a competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;approach-2-ship-with-minimum-sub-features-then-iterate&quot;&gt;Approach 2: Ship with minimum sub-features. Then iterate.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach works better because most software features never get used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you are a FANG company or even if you are, you should save your resources to focus on the area that matters most. Which you only understand after the feature is in the wild for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the feature is secret, allowing beta of minimum required feature is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/eventually_perfect.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/eventually_perfect.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Write Tests after Cleaning Code.</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/writing_test/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Write Tests after Cleaning Code." /><published>2020-11-20T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-11-20T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/test-coverage-after-cleaning-code</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/writing_test/">&lt;p&gt;Quality of code determines the quality of the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unclean code will lead to an unclean test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, the tests will be as hard to understand and modify as the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one decides to improve code quality, then all of the tests to be refactored too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the workload will be about thrice more work than it needs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better alternative is to write code, clean it, and write tests.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Quality of code determines the quality of the test.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Plan quickly.

&lt;p&gt;I have made this mistake a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent too much time planning and too much time deciding the perfect strategy which often took months to come up and then either never implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later I found out that the hard way was much shorter and would often take me just a few hours or at max a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an analogy in programming which says that a programmer will spend six hours automating something that takes six minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If something is repeated so every frequently then the six minutes saving in time is justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for most things, it is better to move on fast and break things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/move.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/move.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Age is not a perfect measure of experience</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/age/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Age is not a perfect measure of experience" /><published>2020-11-03T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-11-03T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/age</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/age/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/age.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kids-learn-too&quot;&gt;Kids learn too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some kids learn hard skills like playing the piano at a very young age. They often get labelled as a child prodigy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This categorization assumes that the child is born with talents and ignores the fact that he/she has to spend years learning the skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most child piano prodigies start at age 4, by the time they are age 10  they already have 6 years of Piano experience. No doubt they have skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;people-who-learn-faster&quot;&gt;People who learn faster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some people put in more effort to learn to skills properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They either grasp the ideas or maybe had better learning resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, they learned skill with no formal learning/training would take years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;argument&quot;&gt;Argument&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most corporate environments favour “years of experience spent at work” at a primary factor for determining salary and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ignores the ability of the person to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/age.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/age.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">First Hackathon</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/first_hackathon/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First Hackathon" /><published>2020-10-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/first-hackethon</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/first_hackathon/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/first_hackathon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always wanted to participate in one but I was afraid that my skills are not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But after working as a programmer for the last two years,  I realized that almost everyone starts with no skill and figure out a solution eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my goal for joining was to learn as much as I can. I knew I could do at least something even if not at a level I would expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some lessons I learned&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goal-is-not-working-software&quot;&gt;Goal is not working software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal for the organizers was not complete working software. The goal was to see how the problem can be tackled from different points of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;team&quot;&gt;Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team could have been better organized. We almost wasted 2 weeks out of 5. In the second week, I tried taking up leadership, arranging meetings, and talking to people. But the by 3rd week my “leadership”  declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for the decline was that I was managing another full-time project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;support&quot;&gt;Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers were supportive. Plus we had access to AWS Experts. So we could ask them questions on specific issues we were facing with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;experimentation&quot;&gt;Experimentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many teams played it safe. They stuck to what they already knew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We experimented. We tried things we did not know before. Though we did not win the challenge, this experimentation increased our learning and the likeliness that we’ll be better prepared for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/first_hackathon.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="www.ankushchoubey.com/images/first_hackathon.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Software project never ends</title><link href="www.ankushchoubey.com/software_end/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Software project never ends" /><published>2020-10-23T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-10-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>www.ankushchoubey.com/software-end</id><content type="html" xml:base="www.ankushchoubey.com/software_end/">&lt;p&gt;Building software is having no fixed deadline. Below are some reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;software-vs-physical-products&quot;&gt;Software vs Physical Products&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software products are hard to wrap the head around when compared to physical products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A physical product occupies physical space which of course software does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a physical product is made, unless it is designed for modification, it cannot be modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software can be modified and improved at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-is-always-something-to-do&quot;&gt;There is always something to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you look for problems to solve, you’re sure to find something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimize code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean code up and make ready for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix bugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it can be hard at times to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;over-engineering&quot;&gt;Over Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something can be built easily but we spend a lot of time deciding what the future thing might be and then we over-engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been guilty too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-reason-to-stop&quot;&gt;The reason to stop.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is said that in any software product around 70% of features are not used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many software themselves are not used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time spent fixing this trivial non-existent problem can be spent fixing some other big problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;human-intuitions-and-definition-of-done&quot;&gt;Human Intuitions and Definition of Done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans can find ways to improve everything. Our judgment is not objective. We need something objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a strong definition of done can help be objective.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Building software is having no fixed deadline.

Instead, wishing to work for themselves or not to work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some benefits of working at an office that are hard to replicate otherwise are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-circle&quot;&gt;Social Circle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to keep office friendships shallow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a lifetime, we make more friends at the office than from school and college combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These include people from many different backgrounds and age groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-opportunities&quot;&gt;Learning opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-ups in the office want people to take up more responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A win-win is when there is something you want to do or learn that can help solve a business problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is ask!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike school, you can pick and choose a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;experimentation&quot;&gt;Experimentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office also provides opportunities to experiment. Try new things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these things are planned within a team and for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: Proposing a new product idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;hierarchy&quot;&gt;Hierarchy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools have a hierarchy of authority organized by age: Teachers over the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most offices resist age-wise authority. They tend to favor ideas and a person’s past deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unstructured time is hard to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The office provides a well-balanced structure for most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meaning&quot;&gt;Meaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work provides meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing that gives more satisfaction than knowing that customers like your product.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">For many, working 9-5 often is considered non-ideal.

&lt;p&gt;The process for finding the answer is more important so that they can replicate the process later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over-dependence is a  bottleneck. Always providing ready-made solutions seems to turn people weak and dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is your responsibility &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to make them capable of themselves finding the answers and making informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, everyone is free to work on problems that truly matter to them. The once that only they can solve. Allowing people to work in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great companies are structured such that the star entrepreneur/performer can leave the company at any moment. The company will still run just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These terms get biased by people’s past and their current thought processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of these as levels but it’s always hierarchical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rich for someone is being able to afford a house.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rich for someone else is being a billionaire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions like “How to be rich?” are very different for both of those paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Happiness can mean just having basic needs fulfilled or can mean pure excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-other-things-than-getting-defined-vaguely-are&quot;&gt;Some other things than getting defined vaguely are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Love&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modernity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secularism&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suffering&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good/Bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;good-communicators&quot;&gt;Good Communicators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noticed a quality of good communicators when they explain a term&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They listen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then try to understand exactly what the person is trying to say. They’ll ask questions if they have not understood properly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If they have to convey, they convey the exact information at the level that the person can understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the ways they do it is by using the right vocabulary words while keeping things understandable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There are many terms that are not hardcore logic.</summary></entry></feed>
