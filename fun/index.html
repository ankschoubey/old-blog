<h2 id="action-hobbies">
<strong>Action</strong>: Hobbies</h2>
<p>Hobbies are weird in the sense that after an initial interest in doing it we start expecting too much from it.</p>

<p>Each next creation becomes a race to be better than the previous one.</p>

<p>Every-time you show something you cooked or something you madeâ€¦ the first reaction from people isâ€¦ why donâ€™t you open a business??</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No! This is something I do for funâ€¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no real ROI! I donâ€™t want to be famous or make money with this.</p>

<p>Life requires activities that have no other purpose than the joy that activities itself provides.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>If suddenly there is an expected ROI attached it has a probability of not being fun anymore. Though the <strong>result of having an expected ROI to a hobby is that the quality and quantity of output increase a lot</strong>.</p>

<p>Hobbies are an active process: The more effort that has been put in the higher is the reward. <sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="consumption-books-media-and-games">
<strong>Consumption</strong>: Books, Media, and Games</h2>

<p>One of the things that many consider being a waste of time is consumption. Often quotes float around which says something on the lines of Make your own life so exciting that you donâ€™t need to consume anything else.</p>

<p>On one level this may be true but it is a little too extreme.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is watching Silicon Valley a waste of time? Maybe.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Did I get a boost of coding confidence ever since starting Silicon Valley? Hell yeah! ROI was higher.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Was watching One Piece a waste of time? No. I actually enjoyed it.</li>
  <li>Did I get my positivity pumped? Definitely.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most consumption only impacts the mindset of the consumer and does not result in direct action.
The tricky thing is that we donâ€™t know what will get us inspired or changed perspective for the better. If we did knew it already, it would be pretty boring.</p>

<p>Consumption is a passive process: You donâ€™t have to actively work at it.</p>

<h2 id="people"><strong>People</strong></h2>

<p><sup>I actually donâ€™t know how to write this without giving my personal anecdotes. So if you are a programmer explore this section in the DOM ðŸ˜¬.</sup></p>

<div class="secret">
I have been guilty of setting very high standards for people around me and for my behavior towards them too. It is not something I do consciously nor it is something I want to do. <br><br>

The people around me have always been supportive, caring and made me less bored.<br><br>

We are not dealing with creatures of logic. These are people just like me with emotions, ups/downs, discomforts, strengths, and weaknesses.<br><br>

We are social animals made to support each other during the bad and the good. I was and am always available for my friends/family when a problem arose in their life and they need me. But I was never there to share happy moments with them too.<br><br>

Dealing with people is both active and passive:<br>
Active: To be there to be for them when a problem arose and they need.<br>
Passive: To be there to share their happiness.<br>

And since you are someone who took the effort to read this in DOM, I am really grateful. If we have, in some way lost touch just ping :)
