## Approaches

### Unoptimized Solution: O(n) time complexity: Space: O(1)

Lines of code 38

Iterate over both and store minimum one in current; Increment in the list from where minimum came. Once one of the lists is empty, empty the other one.

This solution is highly unoptimized.

```java
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode head = null;
        ListNode current = null;
        
        while(list1!=null && list2!=null){
            ListNode minimum = null;
            
            if(list1.val < list2.val){
                minimum = list1;
                list1 = list1.next;
            } else{
                minimum = list2;
                list2 = list2.next;
            }
            
            if(head == null){
                head = minimum;
                current = minimum;
                continue;
            }
            current.next = minimum;
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        ListNode remaining = list1!=null? list1: list2; 
        while(remaining!=null){ // this iteration is unneccessary
            if(current == null){
                current = remaining;
                head = remaining;
            } else {
                current.next = remaining;
                current = current.next;
            }
            remaining = remaining.next;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
```
