Consistency is the key

Outcomes are lagging measure of your habits. You get what you repeat. 

systems

Life isn't fair. You have what you have. So work with it.

Create customized solutions for yourself.

inputs: prefer to use high quality sources: blogposts are better than Youtueb videos. people make shitty youtube videos


System:
Trusting the system. Astronauts trustt heir rockets. 



Do not stop a compounding process.

Run yourself like a country.


Minimalism

Defination, Eleination, Automate, Librerate.

Deal:

CEO: Cut costs. Eleminate

Self improvement challenges.

accountability

focus on identity level change. not specifics.

Tracking and decision metrics

Anything you want to improve at should have a tracker/journal/metrics/improvement document/plan. and you should plan

A strong system/plan

specify conditions for failure. People won't admit what they want because they afraid. The're afraif because if you specify what you want, you define your conditions for failure.


Either automate or make it so fun that it feels like a game.

It's easier to do something if you love it.
It's easier to do something if it is:
- Obvious
- Easy
- Fun
- Satisfactory
- You love it

for self improvement without self discipline., update your self image.

Systems would involve eventually. not the first one.

Peace; You can be satified when system is running.


Responsibility; Trust that this moment is a dot on your life.


At this time next year what is likely to be your biggest problem? What can you do to preare fot it? or prevent it?
