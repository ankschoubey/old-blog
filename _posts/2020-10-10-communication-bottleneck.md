As a company grows bigger and bigger

At first a company of 1 or 2 produces a lot of productivity.

But soon they realize they don't have enough time or expertise to build there product effectively.

So they start hiring.

The productivity of overall company increases. And there is less stress on each employee.

As more and more work comes, companies keep hiring and increasing their employees.

But after a certain point, the increase is number of employees is not as efficient as it used to be.

The reasons are:

- The larger the number of employees, the harder it is to manage.
- The larger the number of employees, the less likely they are to align with company policies, the more stringent checks are done.
- Good communication becomes a necessasity. Messages have to be passed from one person to another. The time spent in relaying communication is the time that can be spent working on the product.
- This is why having a good communication policy is essential.
- The amount of message hops it takes to replay information from lower level employee to a top level executive is very high. It takes many hops.

Most people don't need information fast. But they need clarity of when they can get a response. Setting time for when you respond helps.

A good communication policy must include:
- Documentation and Recorded training so that employees can find the answers they need by themselves.
- Timeboxed Meeting
- Competition/Suggestions/Feedbacks
