Complex Ideas are often extension of simple ones.

I have been learning System Design lately. And one of the thing I notice time and time again is how useful Algorithms, Data Structures and Design Patterns are.

For example:
A message queue like Kafka is not only simple conceptually but scales to handle much large data.

There goes a lot into making a software. Every tiny improvement. Edge case and it's bugfixes are a contribution of years of research.

But to know that something is an extension of simple concepts like Queue and Pub/Sub is humblings. That the tools that are built are just a combination of ideas that were arranged and executed well.

This is not to say that once can go an build some things advanced by themselves.
