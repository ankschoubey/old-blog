title: Thoughts on Test Driven Development
---

Software engineering isn't only about code. It's engineering

TDD need not be a big deal. It can seem cubersome but there are mindsets and tools that can make transition smoother.

TDD is shown to reduce defectsby a large margin. Tests will save you time in the long run.

There are my initial thoughts on test driven development.

## The Three Laws of TDD
1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

## How to TDD?

1. Assume the test will work properly, what is the minimum test? Write that test.
2. Fix compilation errors if any. [^1]
3. Write minimum code required to pass the test.
4. Iterate

# Making TDD easier

## Usually TDD can be cumbersome because:

1. Testing is extra code
2. You have to switch between current code and tests
3. you have to rerun tests

## Mitigrations

### 1. TDD is a todo list of feature to do

By writing test first, you get clear on what you want to implement. This leads to better design.

### 2. Switch between testing and code easily

In intellij press Ctrl + Shift + T

### 3. Rerun tests automatically

On local: have tests run automatically after each save
