Software engineering isn't only about code. It's engineering

TDD need not be a big deal. It can seem cubersome but there are mindsets and tools that can make transition smoother.

TDD is shown to reduce defectsby a large margin. Tests will save you time in the long run.

There are my initial thoughts on test driven development.

Using testing first development as a todo list of things to do. (Verify testing is better)

Usually testing is cumbersome because:
1. Testing is extra code
You have to switch between current code and tests
- you have to rerun tests

On local: have tests run automatically after each save

Given when tehn
Search for libraries that make easier to test


What to test

Fix the inputs and chekc the output

Assume that the test is working
fix compilation error


The Three Laws of TDD
1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
