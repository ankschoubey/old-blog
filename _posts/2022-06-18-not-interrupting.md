title: Be a better listener by not interrupting

Itâ€™s respectful to let people speak ðŸ—£. If they are are saying something that you donâ€™t agree with. Let them speak completely.

Remember, the goal is to seek to understand, than to be understood.

If you aren't letting people speak then you aren't trying to understand. You're trying to win.

Letting people speak is respectful.

And produces much less drama and clarifies direction.

Donâ€™t wait for your turn to speak again. It's okay to take a few months to think before responding and it's socially acceptable.
