permalink: /content/

A few years ago there was a lot of rage for getting onto social media.

The argument was that once you upload something, your content stays on the internet forever. Therefore earning you money forever.

A few years ago you could easily see people Monopolize a category. 
Like on YouTube,
• Comedy was dominated by Smosh

The problem happened after 2 reasons. 
1. The amount of people uploading “content” has exploded suddenly.
2. Algorithms, making money.
3. Bigger companies

The content is king stands true when we consider:
• It provides value to the consumer.
• It provides enough value that customer returns.
• It provides enough value that customer is likely to buy products you recommend or that you sell.



Search Engines and Personalization of results


Previously personalize results only appeared for feeds, now appear in normal search results toO. This means that everyone who searches for something get different results.
This means that the normal search engine optimization methods no longer work as well as they use to. 

But this also means that you are more likely to target your specific demographic as the algorithm thinks it is the right fit.
