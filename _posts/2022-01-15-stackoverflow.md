I currently use stackoverflow like a repository of doubts and questions.

If I am faced with a problem that I could not find a obvious solution to for a few days, I'll ask a question of StackOverflow.

If I get the solution myself, I'll add an answer to my own question.

This way, I'll have a repository of previously solved technical challenges.
