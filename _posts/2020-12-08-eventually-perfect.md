While developing software there are 2 ways to develop.

One is pack the release with all features.

For example: If a feature which processes different to supports

Pack it to support all file types on Day One.

This works well well when.

Better way to do this is to release with the minimum required feature and then add small releases overtime.

Most software features never get used. Unless you are a FANG company or even if you are, you should save your resources to focus on the area that matters most.

That you only understand after the feature is in the wild for a while. 

Though this approach cannot be used if the feature needs to be a secret. In which case allowing beta tests will be helpful.
