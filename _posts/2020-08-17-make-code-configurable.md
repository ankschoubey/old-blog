title: Make your code configurable.
permalink: /code_configurable/

In one of the posts I wrote previously I explain how programming has become configuration. 

Once you have made your software that might be part of it that might need change. Most changes are simple such as:
Increasing the the font
Changing colors
Somethings that work should work on specific environments or domains
Features such as storage location

Resident hard coding everything, make these things configurable.

Something that can be changed with just a click of a button or by changing properties or via Database.

Small things such as these should not take any time. 

Also, if there is something that some uses like and there is something that other users like, then give them the option to choose it themselves by making the configuration available to them via UI.
