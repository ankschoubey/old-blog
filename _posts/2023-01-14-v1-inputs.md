Human beings and all other animals have needs. And these needs are what drives us to move. Needs display pain of some sort. And fulling that need reduces or mitigates that pain. We can call it pleasure.

Pleasure can be big or small. But the main thing here is: Needs drive us to pursue a solution that would reduce pain and move us towards pleasure.

Like everything there are multiple solutions to a problem. Some solutions are better than others. Some solutions are readily available. Some solutions require effort.

Our body, over a million years, has been adapted to respond to our environment and needs. A part of it is also repeated exposure and training. If the environment requires us to be stronger, like in instance where we are picking up a lot of weights. We become stronger.

If the environment no-longer requires us to be stronger, the body will adapt and put its resources where it can be used.

The change our body & mind goes through is proportional to the problem we are trying to solve. If we are trying to solve a harder problem, our body and mind will adapt more to solve the harder problem and vice a versa.

In the past, there were many problems we faced that are solved now with advances by human civilisation.

For instance, we were required to be strong and develop the skill of hunting, that got replaced when agriculture came along.

So, apart from feeling up time, the second-order consequence of this was, we aren’t as strong as our ancestors. 

Think of this phenomena in everything we input in our lives. 

If the input in our life requires or pushes us towards becoming better, we’ll respond to the environment by becoming better. Similarly, if input pushes us towards becoming worse, we become worse.

Like the example of hunting, inputs can sometimes be eliminate or replaced by other inputs.

We face inputs all the time and more in the modern world. We can optimise our inputs so that they best ones stay and keep making us better.
