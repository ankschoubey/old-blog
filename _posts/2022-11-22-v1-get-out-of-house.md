title: Getting out of the house is the way you become a responsible ball of energy.

## Why we sit at home?

During the pandemic, many of us got into an habit of just sitting at home.

We let laziness creep in slowly. And now we think it’s something normal. But it’s not normal.

## What does it do to our physical health?

Human body is made to move. Moving makes our muscles tired, leading to better sleep at night.

Moving physically is how our body releases stress during flight or fight. Because flight or fight is literally a physical action.

Moving and getting enough sun ☀️ is also how our body produces enough growth hormones.

## What does it do to our mental health?

Going outside and looking at the world is the best way to grow.

We find different unique obstacles.

We find that we can take on unseen challenges.

That we can talk to different people and gain from their experiences.

Going outside keeps us stimulated.

It keeps us away from loneliness.

## What are the things we notice once we are outside the house?

Once you go outside and come back, you’ll find people in your home who haven’t been going outside enough to be too different.

Many of them are half depressed and won’t even realize it.

It’s a relatively sad dull house with low energy.

And then you come home and feel like a ball of energy.

You inspire others and make them move. They may not be at their 100% but they’ll be at some percent better.
