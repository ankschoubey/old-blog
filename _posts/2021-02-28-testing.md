## Thinking
You should not make assumptions. Always test. 

## Productivity 
Testing makes it certain that you are moving in the right direction.

Test small, test often, and test fast.

## Code
Keep your test coverage 100%. A good way to do that is that every line of commit should have test coverage 100%.

Test isolated pieces (Unit Test) before testing with other components (Integration Test).

TDD is 50% more efficient in the long term.

Testing is insurance. It may not find anything but when it does it saved big time.

The cleaner your code, the cleaner the tests.

Writing unit tests first only works well when you know exactly what you want to write. If you are experimenting. It may be useless.

## Medical Field
The more you test, the more data points you have. The easy it will be to isolate the infected and avoid disease spread.

## Maths

You never accept the alternative hypothesis. You always reject it. You would almost never know if a hypothesis is 100% current. Unless it is a logical statement.

To test, you can plug the numbers right in and see if the equation holds true.

## Learning

If you are learning, you can only know if you have learned right by testing yourself.
