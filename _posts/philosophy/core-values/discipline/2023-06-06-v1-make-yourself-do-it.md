All of our problems are emotional problems. Logical problems are solved easily. The emotional problem is how we feel.

We seek books that tell us the exact same thing in a different way that eases how we feel. i.e. how we feel impacts us.

**We need a strong why to do things**. And here may be some ways to ease your emotions to do it.

Below are a few mental patterns that can be used to “Make yourself Do it”. Treat these as thought experiments.

## Thought Experiments

### Turn off your brain. And do it

Don’t think. Don’t rationalize. You know what the activity is, just do it.

### Imagine how you’d feel once you have accomplished this small task

1. The feeling of accomplishment.
2. Not having anything over your head.
3. Free to do other things.

### Be mindful of how you are feeling and then continue feeling it while you do the item

### Just get started and wait for 20 min

### If you get this task done, you don’t have to think about it again

You won’t have anything hanging over your head.

### How will you reward yourself after doing this task? Or what will you do during the break?

### What would this look like if this were easy?

### Winners do it regardless of how they feel

### Make things compelling

1. What you do
2. Why you do
3. How you do
4. Where you do
5. With whom you do

### Fit that image of a brighter future in your mind

### If you can’t fit an image of a brighter future, imagine exercising your discipline
