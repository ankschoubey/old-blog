When you stop thinking about everyone else, life gets a little bettwrz

Like dancing freely like noone is wathching. No judgement. No pressure.

Just fun. Then you look around and see everyone have fun. And that’s that.

Peak performance comes from the firs tstep.

Cuz when your rational mind is depressed or stressed or it’s ram filled already. The emotional mind takes over. So therefore knock that depression and stress diwn. And go ultra instinct.
