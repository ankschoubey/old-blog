title: Let the world do what it wants to do, you follow your core values

Your core values are who you are to the core. People around you should be able to guess your core values. Even without you explicitly telling them.

If they aren’t able to guess with a good degree of accuracy, you may have a branding issue or more likely you aren’t living to your core values fully.

At the same time, discussing your core values with others especially giving reasoning when you take certain decisions that other’s find weird is a good way to deepen your understanding and let other’s find hole in your values.

Explaining my core values with my friends and family has helped them understand me. And it has helped me be more genuine version of myself.
