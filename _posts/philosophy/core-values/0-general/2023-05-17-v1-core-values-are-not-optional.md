We start as protected children. We are protected again from the ups and downs of life. As we grow old, this protection is lifted.

For some people this protection continues, therefore we see 40 y.o who have not grown up. But most grow up in maturity sooner.

There are many tragedies, nature (like death) and unnatural (like malevolence, betrayal, etc.) that are in our path. All these demands from us to be better than we are.

We need something to offset the tragedies of life. We need to live by a set of principles and actions that can help us mitigate most of these tragedies and manage what remains to the best of our ability. And then we also need to enjoy what remains and this must be prioritized.

And here’s the optimistic part, the principles we set up and the core values we choose and act on do set many things that couldn’t have been set in order otherwise. i.e. you reap the benefits of setting those core values in the long term.

In the short term, it may be tempting to take a shortcut. In the long term, however, you’ll be the strongest version of yourself.

The honest action you did today, however small, is towards that path. The room you cleaned voluntarily, you voted towards becoming responsible, again setting you on the same path.

Don’t deviate from the path. Walk. One foot after the other. Act. One action after the other and you’ll set yourself to be **freer**.
