title: Remind yourself of your core values at all times.

Humans are forgetful. We have infinite (useless things) to attend to.

Keep your core values front and center. Base your life around them. Not anything or anyone else.

Wake up each day choosing to live your core values better.

Sleep each day reflecting on them. Choosing how you could improve you could improve your practices or how you could improve your values.

Keep a place where itâ€™s visible at all times.
