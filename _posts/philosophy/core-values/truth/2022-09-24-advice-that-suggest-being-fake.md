You have to always be truthful.

Advice like: "Don't message as soon as you receive the text because it makes you look like you have no job."

Well, there are two ways to handle this.

Either you can be fake and wait for x number of minutes to reply.

Or you can have a wonderful life and be content with yourself, and when you get that message, you are busy having a job.

:)

Often the "act fake" advice has a reason; you have to find that reason and become that person.
