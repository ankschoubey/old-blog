title: Why we should strive to tell the truth always?
toc: true

**Living and speaking your truth makes you free**:

Why lie when you can tell the truth and be free? And will it make things better? That's a double bonus.

**Telling the truth is acceptance of how things really are**:

We are always asked to accept reality as it is. Acceptance helps us get clearer, helping us make better decisions and avoid traps.

**Truth always comes in the long run.**:

No matter what you do, the truth will eventually come out.

**Your body can feel when you are lying**.:

When you lie or do something untruthful, your body reacts. Let's say you hate something, and you are not saying it. You'll develop resentment and stress.

**If we are not truthful, someone else will suffer**:

The cost of lying isn't something we always bear in the short term. Sometimes it's others. Suppose you go to a doctor, and he doesn't tell you that you might be at risk of a deadly disease and that now is a good time to avoid drinking. What impact would it have on you?

**Living and speaking truthfully orients you properly**:

If you can't lie, you'll be hesitant to slack off at work if you want to face daily standup the next day. Thus, orienting you to become a better person and get the work done. Or it'll help you solve the problem that makes you avoid your work.

If you can't live a lie, you won't cheat on exams, orienting you properly to become the kind of person that will pass the exam.

{% include note.html content="Remember this always, if you speak the truth and act in truthful ways, the world will arrange itself in the best possible manner to you.<br>If you lie or donâ€™t live truthfully, the world will arrange in the worst possible manager." %}

**Truth is a shield. That survives scrutiny**:

That protects you against lies of any kind.

Truth and peace are directly correlated. One increases or decreases another.
