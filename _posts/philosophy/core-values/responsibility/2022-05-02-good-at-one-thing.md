title: Being good at one thing doesn't automatically make you better at another
---

This essentially means you still have to put in the work.

If you are good at technical skill, that doesn't automatically make you the best if you are lacking in communication.

Similarly, if you are ethical/follow ethics rigorously that doesn't mean you'll win at life. There are other things also. And just by following a ethic or being good at a certain skill doesn't make you entitled to everything.

This is a great equilizer for all. 

No one is good at everything. And therefore requires help from others.
