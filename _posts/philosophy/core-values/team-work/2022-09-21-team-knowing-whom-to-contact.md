# Silos

We developers love working in silos. We love our technical challenges.

Our effort is proportional to how complex the challenge is.

But for business and true Agility, it's more important to always focus on end users. And to focus on what's truly important from a business POV. 

Similarly, there are moments when one needs to collaborate with other teams, and having different teams in the loop is truly useful.

The higher the quality of collaboration, the less rework a developer has to do.

# Knowing who to contact

On this path, the important thing is to remember whom to connect to and when. Knowing organizational structure is helpful. If there is no organizational structure available. Create one.

Go through and list out all the stakeholders and different teams. Who is the decision maker there?

Ideally, everyone should be pouring in a semi-bureaucratic way.

The development team must connect to other groups to get work done.

These teams might be specific to your organization. So wherever you work, figure out what all the departments and teams are. Who are the key stakeholders to contact, and when?

And make sure you loop them in when taking a decision.

And, of course, you can use Gherkin BDD files to ensure everyone is in sync.

So here are a few teams and stakeholders that are common and imp:
