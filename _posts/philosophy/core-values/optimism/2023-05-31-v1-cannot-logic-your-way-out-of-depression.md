I’ll share something personal and long. I learned it from HealthyGamerGG.

You can’t logic your way out of depression.

## Logical people get depressed more and more strongly than rest

In normal people depression in 9% of people. If you go to the top 2 percent of high IQ people, it is 36%.

Depression is like auto-immune dysfunction of the mind. It’s your brain turning against itself. The stronger your brain is, the worst it does when it turns against itself.

The more logical someone is, the more they rely on logic to get through. So they have underdevelopment emotional intelligence and awareness.

If you ask them, they’ll describe very logical events. And all those logical events will be true. And since they are true, that makes it more of a reason for them to be depressed. But they won’t describe emotion. Cuz they aren’t in touch with it.

And when someone is emotional, it highjacks their logic. They can be logical and say they are logical. But their assumptions before logic can take place is itself hijacked. So, logic doesn’t work.

For example, a depressed person will more likely see the negatives than the positives.

Plus, smart depressed people have the habit of saying to themselves, "I should have had this figured out. But I haven’t had it figured out." This creates shame.

## The way out is to develop emotional awareness

The way out of this is for the logical person to develop emotional awareness. To recognize what they are feeling and process the feeling independently of logic. To develop perspective.

It’s after they have processed their emotions independent of logic, that they feel a bit better and then they can use their logical brains i.e. when emotional one shouldn’t use their logic.

He also said that the processing of emotions can be crying too. After that, you can use logic. Or talking. Or meditation or journaling.

He recommends meditation (focusing on the breath) for logical people. That’s the only way to clean the perceptions.

This problem is also something I learned about people with high conscientiousness.  They tend to tear themselves apart psychologically trying to find what caused the problem so that it won’t repeat. And it's hard on them
