title: Human Intuition while working in Technology
---

Often when talking about process improvement, we focus on only technology element.

Human element is ignored. This is understandable. technology can enforce rules that improve the process easily. Technology can also remove a lot of human evidence.

Developing the human intuition is about understanding why something is being done more than how something is being done. 

Because once someone understands why something is done, they can suggest ways to prove it for themselves locally.

This is usually the thing I find lacking in most devops, Agile, TDD and similar concepts.
