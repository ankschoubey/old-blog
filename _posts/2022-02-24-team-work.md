1. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Treat yourself the way you want to be treated.

2. Everyone’s problems/expectations are similar on one level:

- everyones want to share and want to be really listened to their point of view. 
- Everyone want to feel safe and safe enough to trust. 
- Everyone wants to he respected: respected of boundaries (hopefully healthy ones).
- Everyone want people to support them even if it’s little.

3. Everyone has ego. 

- If you criticize the person, you poke the ego. 
- If you critize an approach, then probability that their ego will be poked in a healthy way and it will be on your side or atleast open to discussion.

This is to say you don’t want somone to win or lose. You want Win-Win. Win-Win is a win for all parties to a certain degree.

4. To build trust, you have to trust and try opening up. But open up on solid ground. You don’t want to be naïve because opening up increases probability of being hurt but also it won’t reciprocate. You want to build trust “together”, not being trust one sided.

Everything in “Team Work” is about doing things “together”.

5. *This one is recent for me*: Let everyone (others and yourself) choose and solve their own local problems.

They have right to choose what they want to focus on. You may suggest or lead by example. But forcing you opinions rebounds.

Plus forcing opinions assumes that one really knows “life” which probably no one does fully.

6.  Having mutual respect leads to better understanding and less drama.

# Communication

These things have to be automatic. It isn't ideal to keep thinking about these. Pick on one area at a time to work on.

## 1-1 Communication

Aim for reaching an understanding.

In all communication, some information is lost. By choosing the right medium, listening better and articulating properly; one can reach close to 100% retention of information.

### Choosing the right medium

Communication mediums are quite dependent.

### Listening

Remember, the goal is to seek to understand, than to be understood.

Listen carefully and listen everything. No matter how silly on mundane something seems. It maybe of value to the other person. Don't negate anything by saying it's dumb. It may or maynot be dumb. Listen and ask followup questions.

Rather than interrupting, wait for when the person has stopped. Even if they are are saying something that you don’t agree with. Let them speak completely. This not only helps understand the other person better, this is more respectful.

Don't wait for your turn to speak. When the person has stopped speaking, you could take a moment to think and then speak or ask followup questions. It isn't akward to wait and then speak.

Also, it's not your respo to overly try to make a situation pleasant. Over trying makes situation more akward.

### Speaking

#### Agree to what you find right.

Often someone interrupts us or are in a emotional state and are continuing to talk. Let them speak and then agree to the points you agree with. This helps establish a common base for further conversations.

#### If you don't understand something, re-iterate what the person is saying and ask if it's right.

Specially in complex or emotional issues, understanding someone is hard. Doing the aboves means that you'd have understood better and the person knows you have understood better.
