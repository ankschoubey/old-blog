In some sense, the Piano is just a speaker that is manual and more satisfying.

## Learn sheet music
You don't need to memorize songs if you can read sheet music.

It's much faster to progress in the long run.

It is joyful to open any random song and play it without having to watch a YouTube tutorial for each song.

The more sheet music you see, the easier it is to read.

## Practice

Every new technique (like chords, scales) learned will make you a better pianist. Thou should not skip anything.

Isolate parts of pieces to practice better.

Practice regularly. 10-15 minutes daily is better than an hour once a week.

Initially learning a piece, play slowly. Increase speed gradually. Once you are at the desired pace, always play at that pace. Not fast. Not slow.

If you suck as a new technique, continue practising it in the upcoming days. You'll get it in 15 days.

Learn techniques from many sources.

## Being Calm
You'll make mistakes if you are not calm. So always keep calm and check your breath.

Banging your fingers is a sure way to suffer. Stiff hands will become loose as you practice more.

## Get proper tools
Get a proper stand and seat. You'll find you play instantly 50% better.

## Humility

If you think you play well, you'll likely cry seeing Kids on YouTube play better than you.

Learning Piano is a rabbit hole. You might probably not learn everything.
