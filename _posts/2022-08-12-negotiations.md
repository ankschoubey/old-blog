## What is Negotiation?

Negotiation is when people come to a consensus.

It isn't about winning. It's about Win-Win!

We can't just think about ourselves. We have to think about everyone. What's good for others is good for me.

If someone else is happy, they'll pay us back somehow. Similarly, when we are happy, we'll pay them back.

## Is it that important to learn to negotiate?

Negotiation happens in every stage of life. And many times a day.
- Monetary negotiations are the most transparent form of negotiations.
- Negotiations happen beyond money matters too. Things like marriage, friendships, idea proposals, etc. 
- Even you negotiate with yourself to get work done. Like, oh, why do I not want to do this? Can I work for 5 min?

Negotiations are non-stop and non-avoidable. Therefore, negotiations are essential.

## What do negotiations involve?

Negotiation involves many steps: 
1. Knowing what you want.
2. Knowing what the other person wants.
3. Knowing the market.
4. Expressing what you want.
5. Listening and understanding what the other person really wants.
6. Discuss possible scenarios, outcomes, compromises or different angles.
7. Accepting, being content and following through on your part
8. Hoping the other person feels accepted, content and follows through.

Since there are these many steps, the area where things can fail many. Therefore negotiations are complicated. And they have to be learned and practised.
