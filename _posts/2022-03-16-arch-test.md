title: Java Architecture Testing with ArchUnit
---

# Reason for Architecture Testing

Once size of codebase increases, it becomes harder and harder to manage a lot of little things. This is specially true when multiple people are working on it.

For example, if you are having a @Entity and want to ensure all of it have certain javax validation whenever someone creates a new @Entity.

It may happen that someone who is working on the code base in future does not know about a certain principle to follow.

For such cases, Architecture Testing is idea.

# ArchUnit

ArchUnit provides Architecture Testing for Java and ensure design principles and standards are followed.

ArchUnit work well with JUnit.

# Example

If you want to ensure all String fields for Request Objects have @Size annotation, you could write it with ArchUnit.

```java
    fields().that().haveRawType(String.class)
    .should()
    .beAnnotatedWith(Size.class)
```

Since I have started using Arch Unit, the quality of code has improved by a huge margin.
