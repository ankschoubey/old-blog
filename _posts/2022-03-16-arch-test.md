description: "Architecture of a SW project is one of the most important pillars to speedly delivery of product. Usually, the intend of initial SW designer isn't passed to team members without continous code-review cycle. 

Architectural testing can significantly improve code quality and collaboration by introducing Architectural rules as simple tests.

As a result, it can significantly reduce code-review efforts and can also help extend maintainability of code beyond initial development as newer members join the team."

## Introduction

SW Architecture is one of most important pillars of a SW project. Following Engineering and Agile practices are part of the equation too. But having a clean extensible architecture faciliates a much faster development.

When working with a group of people, it is significantly time consuming to enforce rules for maintanability. For example: it's common to find different classes that do the same thing named differently. Some team member names it as controllers. Some name it has handler.

Similarly, there are places that need special care. For example: API Requests body needs to be validated.

There are a few ways to enforce architecture:
1. Strong Linter
2. Creating Helper Libraries
3. Architecture Testing

This particular post will focus on Architectural Testing. 

# What are Architecture Tests?

Architecture tests help enforce rules that are otherwise missed by linters. Linter's do provide some coding standard but usually aren't sophesticated enough for capabilities architecture testing can provide.

For example, if you are having a java `@Entity` and want to ensure all of it have certain `java`x validation whenever someone creates a new `@Entity`.

# Libraries for Architecture Testing

I found 2 libraries:
1. [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/): For Java
2. [TsArch](https://github.com/ts-arch/ts-arch): Typescript version of ArchUnit

# ArchUnit

ArchUnit provides Architecture Testing for Java and ensure design principles and standards are followed.

ArchUnit work well with JUnit.

# Example

If you want to ensure all String fields for Request Objects have @Size annotation, you could write it with ArchUnit.

```java
    fields().that().haveRawType(String.class)
    .should()
    .beAnnotatedWith(Size.class)
```

Since I have started using Arch Unit, the quality of code has improved by a huge margin.

# Implement ArchUnit as TDD for Architecture

With architecture testing, work of an architect now expands and can live long after the architect is gone from the project.

Since every architectural decision is written as a test.

I try to implement this the same way.

For example, I want all tests to be really fast. [I had written an article about it](spring-boot-junit-faster/). And one of the ways is that it requires avoiding `@DirtiesContext` in Spring Boot. And forcing the developer to choose between parallel execution and non-parallel execution.

I can share it with the team and hope everyone follows it. 

But we developers have too many things on our plate, and we juggle a lot. And mostly, it's the code reviewer who'll asses these decisions.

So, I instead write these are ArchTests.

Also, ArchTests can be thought of as TDD. Before starting, the architect decides how everything should look and grow. 

## Formatting ArchUnit Tests

I like the [method/when/then](/method-when-should) format. I have a format that makes it easier to write arch unit tests.

classes/methods/fields
- that: have
- should
