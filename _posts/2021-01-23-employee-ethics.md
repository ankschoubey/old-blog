In previous posts, I discussed the [reasons to be ethical](/why_ethics/) and [how it related to businesses](/business-ethics/). For employees, ethics can be summarised with the Principal-Agent Problem.

### Principal-Agent Problem [^1]
- The Principal wants agents to act like in the best interest of the agent.
- The agent who does act like Principal get rewarded.

## Organization Structure
Organization need to foster an environment for employees to be more ethical. Though there are some things the sole hand of employee.

## The Ethics
- Not accepting bribes and not stealing.
- Not engaging in office politics and maintaining good company culture.
- Focusing on efficiency and conflict resolution. 
  - This means working together to find a solution.
- Take on accountability and responsibility
- Getting work done
