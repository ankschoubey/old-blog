There are many terms that are not hardcore logic.

These terms get biased by people’s past and their current thought processes.

You can think of these as levels but it’s always hierarchical. 

For instance
- Rich for someone is being able to afford a house.
- Rich for someone else is being a billionaire.

The questions like "How to be rich?" are very different for both of those paths.

Likewise, Happiness can mean just having basic needs fulfilled or can mean pure excitement.

## Some other things than getting defined vaguely are
- Success
- Love
- Modernity
- Secularism
- Suffering
- Good/Bad

## Good Communicators

I have noticed a quality of good communicators when they explain a term
- They listen.
- Then try to understand exactly what the person is trying to say. They'll ask questions if they have not understood properly.
- If they have to convey, they convey the exact information at the level that the person can understand.

One of the ways they do it is by using the right vocabulary words while keeping things understandable.
