Maybe this is an ENTP specific problem .

When talking to someone there are terms which are not hard core logic which get biased by people’s past and their current thought process.

You can think of these as levels but it’s always hyrarchical. 

For example:
- Rich for someone is being able to afford a house.
- Rich for someone else is being a billionaire.

The questions like: How to are very different for both of those paths.

Similarly for word like Happiness:

- For some happiness is just having basic needs fullfullized
- For some happiness is pure excitement.

I have noticed really a quality of good speakers explain term
- They listen
- Then try to understand exactly at. what the level the person is talking
- If they have to convey, they convey the exact information.

Some Other things than get defined differently by different people:
- Love
- Success
- Modernity
- Secularism
- Suffering
