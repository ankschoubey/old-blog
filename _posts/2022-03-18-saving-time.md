Categorize the type of activities you want to do.

Plan and track your day diligently. Every hour. But maybe not every minute.

Meditate. You need attention.

Perform activities that give back time. -> Time Assets.

Mono Task. Do one thing at a time. You’ll save 50% more time.

You only have 4 productive focus hours. Don’t let anyone distract you.

Prioritize task: Use Eisenhower Matrix
