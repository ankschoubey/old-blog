We have a finite life. Though it is long enough to get important things done.

Your habits are reenforced. If you waste time regularly, youâ€™ll continue to waste time.

Letâ€™s suppose your time is worth minimum wage.
Assume that to be 100Rs per hour. Letâ€™s suppose you waste 6 hours a day. Thatâ€™s 600Rs per day. 1,80,000 lakh rs per month. 21,60,000 rs per year. Over 10 years itâ€™s 2 crore rs.

Plus this calculation ðŸ§® excludes compounding. Time spent early will compound.
