title: Creating Systems To Automate Goal Achievement
toc: true
---

The only way to become a high performer and fulfil your full potential is to create, iterate and rely on your systems.

In programming terms, systems are `O(log n)`, and No-Systems are like brute force `O(n^3)`. Systems allow us to focus on the task and not reply to other things.

## What are the benefits of creating a system?

Systems allow you to free up your mental load. Allowing you to perform at your best, be decisive, and be confident that everything will work properly.

Systems allow you to fall back and know everything is okay and taken care of. They are comparable to taking breaks and letting go. We take breaks and let go knowing we are stronger and in control.

Systems allow us to be happy at the moment and know that the path we are on is the best path there is.

## What are the different kinds of systems?

Different kinds of systems are:

1. Training
2. Assistance via Environment
3. Automation
4. Habits

Each system has its pros and cons, and when to use each depends on what you are trying to accomplish.

**Training**: Learning and deliberately practising each and every step of something. This includes re-training to keep yourself sharp and eliminate flaws.

**Assistance via Environment**: Setting your environment in a way that makes it easy to accomplish your tasks.

**Automation**: Using Technology to its full advantage as a modern human. This would take our output from 1 to 20x.

**Habits**: Creating healthier habits that are in our best interest.

## Training and Testing

You rely on training and testing to get better at a skill.

Suppose you want to give a public speech, create a script, practice it a few times, maybe record yourself, iterate and then give the speech.

The stages of progression in training and testing are following.

Level **1: Learn**: You are learning about the topic and actually practising the things you learn. There is no learning about actually doing. You need #skinInTheGame as early as possible.
Level **2: Cover the flow**: You take things slow and try to cover the flow a few times. i.e. you practice something end to end but slowly.
Level **3: Rectification**: You rectify everything starting from your weakest point because that’s where you’ll get the most growth.
Level **4: Iterate and practice**: You continuously iterate and practice.
Level **5: Mimic the real world** until you feel confident to go out into a real situation
Level **6: Graduate** but sometimes return to one of the previous steps to iterate.
