#### Clean Code #4

# Rule of thumb: Avoid filtering loops

SQL/Databases are good at 2 jobs: storing data. filtering data as fast as possible. **You're for loop cannot compete with SQL.**

The performance of your program will be much faster if you let SQL manage the filtering of data. Plus it will also result in a smaller line of code.

Try to filter with smaller queries with a smaller number of columns before fetching all the columns. Smaller the data, the faster will be the data transfer. You will find a better example of this in the section of Complex Queries bellow.

# **Use ORM**

For Spring (Java), ideally, use JPA method query things.**\*\*\***

For Python, SQLAlchemy is popular and preferred or Django ORM for Django. (I have less experience with this)

# Complex queries

In the case of Java, you can also JPA specific things like Specifications or Criteria API.

Honestly, I havenâ€™t tried them I know they exist. I have seen them and found that the code looked really ugly

I do find Django ORM to be easier than Spring JPA (you can pass arguments rather than always create a separate function).

#### Break down big-bang (complex) queries into multiple simpler queries

**\* This might be very controversial and I have not seen this talked about anywhere or used in other peopleâ€™s code. **You are not likely to use this unless you are like me (bad at ORMs).\*\*\*

Many times you have a complex feature like search and you want to filter by multiple parameters.

What usually ends up happening you end up with a custom query generator or Criteria API (Java) or a query which is too long. Especially if this query requires additional features like ordering and pagination.

I think a simpler solution is to break it into smaller queries. I give a simplified example below.

Note that this is a much simpler version of what you would encounter but I think it will make the point.

There are 3 tables:

**_Suppose you want to find who are male grandparents of children whose name start with â€˜Aâ€™_**

You can go for some complex query like

![Output](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/484/1*_77Yv8zDeWB0AGi0vJBSIg.png)

These 33 lines can quickly increase in size when you have too many tables. Multiple shorter queries are always much better than one **big bang query**.

Iâ€™ve seen queries which go beyond 100 lines ðŸ˜–

**Making changes in such large 100+ line queries is a pain.**

(Even when writing the 33 line query above, I introduced bug by not writing join on lines 30 and 31. writing smaller queries helped me debug.)

You could break into something simpler queries like:

Then code the method yourself to call these in a certain sequence:

You will find that even though your line of code has increased, the modularity of code has also increased and these functions can be arranged in any way you like.
