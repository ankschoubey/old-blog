Information is clutter. Applying information is power.

The more applicable information you can find, the more you can apply them and make better decisions.

## Why information should be applied?
Information if not applied is meaningless unless it is your profession to find and document new information.

By appling information faster, you will solve your problems faster or atleast move towards solving your problems faster.
  
The information that is not learned will be forgotten.

## Finding applicable information

There are many ways to find applicable information, these are a few that come to mind.

### Planning
A plan may or may not be used, but planning is useful because it uncovers many aspects of the problem. Also, it is easier to discovers paths to avoid.

### Asking Questions

Frame your questions accurately.

Know the right people who can answer your question. Internet also allows us to connect to "experts" who are happy to answer you.

Specially having friends and collegues you can reply on helps in avoiding pitfalls.

Googling the right way is also a key skill.

### Reading Books

Some non-fiction books are made in a way where you can skip chapters liberally. Do so, close the book and live your life. 

For other non-fiction books, you can do the same if you understand the topic enough. If you don't, don't skip because you'll risk learning false information.

## Being Multidisciplinary

Aspects from one discipline apply to other. Learn something random and you'll find you apply the same principle in other field.

It seens better to learn by categorizing. Like: A music instrument, a physical activity, a social activity, etc.

### Mental Models and Heuristics.

These can help you find out more infomation about a topic faster by making good guesses.

Some of my favorite mental models are:
- Inversion (Most Useful)
- Occam's razor
- Map is not a territory
- Confirmation Bias
- Circle of Competence
- Pareto Principle

### [Make Time and Think](/think/)

Thinking means youâ€™ll question things from the first principles. To see if they are valid or not. 

Then you scrutinize it. By thinking you find the solutions yourself and reply less on other sources.
