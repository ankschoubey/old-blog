I used to love Deep Learning and wanted it to be my career option.

I learned it for many about 2 years. After work, sitting for an hour or two. There were often weeks when I understood nothing. I was early in my career then and things would likely be different of I try things out now.

Though I never used Deep Learning as a job, there are a few skills I learned that have persisted.
- Watching Videos at 2x Speed
- Understanding many technological field
- Grasping hard technological concepts much faster
- Pushing through a mental limit break

There is immense upside to doing hard things even if they are not directly use.

Indirectly doing hard things changes us for the better.
