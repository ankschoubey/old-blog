Cloud has recently excited me more than anything else in the world. Consider this a fanboy rant.

I was avoiding cloud because it seemed like a buzz word. Something I was hearing since I was 12 yo.

Recently I started learning AWS. Here are some things that I find really really amazing.

These are a few things that have changed my mind.

## Cloud is a Win-Win

Cloud provides a lot of consumer surplus. Traditionally, one would have to set 

Cloud is such that the price of owning and maintaining for the individual user than if they would have built a server themselves.

While for the cloud provider, it is also cheap because they provide it at scale.

## Cost: Pay only for what you use

The cost can be optimized further by setting up things properly.

## Computational Power

Specially in fields like Machine Learning you need high computation.

## Maintainance

## More Easy than traditional server

Unless you are setting up your own cloud infrastructure... vendor cloud solutions are is easy

## The cloud powers: Special APIs

Almost all cloud providers provide spcieal api for things like machine learning. One need not be a expert.
