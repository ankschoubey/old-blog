My dear younger self, 

You believed DevOps is bs and a buzzword. It kind of is. But it is highly valuable and important too.

Though you won’t always build something awesome from scratch and instead configure an existing tool to do the job, without DevOps you won’t be free to code.

You’ll spend all your time maintaining and deploying your code manually.

In this post, I’ll try to convince you why upper management likes DevOps so much.
## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a mixture if tools and practices that make it efficient to build and maintain code.

Agile is what to do. DevOps is how to do.

DevOps practices occupies different stages of product development and beyond.

DevOps is such a broad term with loose definition that many other concepts are plugged into DevOps as a “best practice”.

DevOps also get’s merged with security and called DevSecOps.

For example: Pair Programming.

You cannot copy another organizations DevOps structure as it is. Your organization and products are unique. Make your own style. Don’t copy google or facebook,

Since DevOps relies so much on automation tools, some things can be achieved faster.
- Increase compliance
- Streamlining of processes
- Automating repeatable tasks

Some DevOps practices that are very helpful are.
- Build Automation: Jenkins
- DB Automation: Liquibase, Flyway
- Code Linting: Sonar, CAST
- Continuous Integration: CI
- Continuous Delivery: CD
- Continuous Deployment: CD
- Continuous Monitoring: ELK, Databriks
- API Management?

While Developing:
- Test Driven Development: TDD
- Behavious Driven Development: BDD
