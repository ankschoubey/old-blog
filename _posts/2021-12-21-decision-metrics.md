Percentage Change

## Percentage Of Plan Followed

It often happens with habits that we aim for a perfect streak. Aiming for a perfect streak is not ideal because once a streak breaks we get demotivated.

Aiming for a streak undermines the progress made on other days.

A better alternative is to aim for percent of times/days we followed the plan within a specific time period.

Example:
Suppose you want to not slip into a habit, a useful thing would be:
- Within a month, I would make sure to have a 80/85% success rate.
- So if you follow slip up 4 days in a month, it's still 86.66% which is success!

## Effort taken: +1 | -1 aim for 0

This may sound evil at first but I'll justify it later.

Ideally, in a relationship, you want to aim for a roughly 50% partnership.

If you are putting too much effort or putting too little, efforts are not equal and relationship fails.
It's not right for yourself and for the other person to have this kind of skewness. The person who is putting more effort, would start feeling bad eventually.

So +1 |-1 aim for 0 is for such conditions. 

Pick a time period, let's say a week or a month, start from 0 and add 1 each time you put and effort, add -1 if the partner does. If the number is too away from 0, try to make it 0. If it's too positive, reduce your efforts. If it's more negative, put more effort.

In case it's positive, wait, reduce your efforts, spend time during something else.

If it's too high in positive, reduce your effort even more. It's the only way to make sure things are okay.

## Avoid grey area

and have to courage to move on.

If you are in grey area, you may have already lost. You'll try to rationalize and do things.
