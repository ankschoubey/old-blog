### Importance

Good ideas are common and meaningless.

Good execution is rare and therefore valuable.

### Originality

No idea is truly original. Be flexible to adapt to new ones. [^1]

Most 'unique' ideas fail. Successful once are spinoffs of already present ideas. [^2]

### Finding

In the case of hyper-growth startups, ideas are counter-intuitive. If it seems sensible it is likely a bad idea. [^3]

Most hyper-grown startup ideas don't look like startup ideas at all. [^3]

Trying to find a hyper-growth startup idea is a bad idea. [^3]

The way to find better ideas is to explore the world and know your customers. [^3]

Think Big [^5]

### Get started

Rather than trying to find the perfect idea, start small with the one you have and iterate. [^4]
