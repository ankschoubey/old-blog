## Approaches

### O(time) time; O(space) space; n lines

Check if the last bit is 1 by (n&1). Do the right unsigned shift (logical shift). Loop.

```java
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        while(n!=0){
            count+=(n&1);
            n=n>>>1;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
```
