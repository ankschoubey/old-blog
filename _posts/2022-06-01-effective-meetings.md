title: Running Effective Meetings
---

Meeting is a place than can bring in new ideas and insights and save everyone's time and effort.

Therefore it's very important to have effective productive meeting.

There are someways to have effective meetings:

# Setting the context

Most meetings aren't as effective because people involved don't have context behind what is being discussed.

This can be solved a few ways:

- Agenda: A few set of outlines or questions
- Pre-reading material
    - A set of material to read / watch before attenting the meeting. 
    - It's better to send a specific link than just mention the name of the topic.
- Set the context during meeting
    - Start the meeting by setting the context. 
        - Why we are doing what we are doing?
        - What do we intend to get out of this meeting?

# Encourage Discussion

- Round Robin Asking/Sharing Inputs
    - Many people are shy and don't speak up. To get everyone involved discuss concepts/questions in a round robin fashion.
    - You could even ask specific people who may be too silent of "What do you think about this?"

# Keeping it short/exact

- Set time on the calendar
    - It's unproductive to wonder when the meeting is. 
    - It's best to have an exact date and time with the meeting link if it's online (#postCovidWorld)
- Short Meeting Durations
    - Aim for 30 min meetings. Max 45. 
    - The longer the meeting drags on, the more everyone will feel bored and start loosing attention.
    - If the meeting is dragging out longer, take a break. 10 minutes should be good enough.

# Action List

Towards the end of the meeting:

- Setting up time for next meeting and putting it on Calendar
    - Create a action list. A MoM of sorts
    - Discuss outcomes of the meeting and have it written down along with who is accountable for it.
