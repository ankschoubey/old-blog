Companies that don’t actually care about solving a problem.

They are here only for money, increasing valuation, getting more investors, getting sales by tactics such as selling themselves (coupons), brand, and social media posts.

Then when everything is all set, the founders will exit without hesitation. Not because the problem has been solved but because they didn’t care about solving the problem at all. It was just a facade.

**Counter Argument:** [Businesses are for making money](/for_profit/)
