Here are some resume tips. Most apply to software engineering roles.

Always 

# LinkedIn

LinkedIn is a professional network. It isn't a network of friends. So go with he hopes of making a "network" connection. This might require a shift in thinking.

You'll have to apply for to apply for too many jobs and ask too many referrals. You can use template extensions on chrome such as [Magical Expander](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magical-text-expander-aut/iibninhmiggehlcdolcilmhacighjamp). :)

# Resume

## Have an ATS Friendly resume format

Here is the template I use: [New template - Software Engineering Lead - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iTtI7EG0Q74-qgmFLIApCKIJEA-248i-I8LgNbL9pIU/edit)

## Update your resume regularly.

Find items to add to your resume. At work, look for things that will look good on your resume. Mainly the most challenging responsibilities/tasks look good on a resume.

You are likely selling yourself short. Write down everything you do. Then find our things your employeer might need.

Don't be shy to add what you are doing right now.
- Example: In-process of implementing a continuous delivery pipeline.
- This is also because it takes time to find a job. So it maybe 1-2 months before someone picks your resume. At that point resume is already outdated.

Find other people resume by searching something like: [www.linkedin.com "microsoft" view my resume](https://www.google.com/search?q=www.linkedin.com+%22microsoft%22+view+my+resume&rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN995IN995&ei=t-lQY_3IIcPEz7sPqOeuuAM&ved=0ahUKEwi9gPSRlu76AhVD4nMBHaizCzcQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=www.linkedin.com+%22microsoft%22+view+my+resume&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBggAEAgQHjIFCAAQhgMyBQgAEIYDOgoIABBHENYEELADOg0IABDkAhDWBBCwAxgBOgYIABAHEB5KBAhNGAFKBAhBGABKBAhGGAFQ9rMCWMHEAmCnxwJoBXABeACAAYwBiAGEApIBAzAuMpgBAKABAcgBDcABAdoBBggBEAEYCQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)

## Getting wordings right.

Use Grammarly. The Premium version will give you more points. 

Use active voice always.

Use resumeworded.com to get a score on your resume and improvement points.

You can also use topresume.com to get a score.

## Optimize for readability

Add a summary section. Read the full-stack resume section on summary: https://www.fullstackresume.com/.

```
[Your professional identity] with [how many years in the profession] of broad experience in [Areas of expertise] with a willingness to learn and master/practice [Areas of Interest]. [Strongest area of expertise] specialist/practitioner/expert/adept.
```

Put your name, and contact details in the footer. It serves as a call to action.

Make it easier for people to find things and find you.

# Applying for Jobs

- LinkedIn: [NathanDuma/LinkedIn-Easy-Apply-Bot: Automate LinkedIn Easy Apply job applications and answer application-specific questions.](https://github.com/NathanDuma/LinkedIn-Easy-Apply-Bot) You're welcome! 
- AngelList: [Easy Apply - Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/easy-apply/pgdkaehkejiaemknlpknmjioedpjaphg)

You have to look for a more targetted approach rather than treating it like a black box.

## Target companies so that you avoid wasting time. #whiteBoxApproach.

It’s more effective to search for “best software companies in x country” or “companies that sponsor visa in x” country. And apply there first.


# Offers

Look at offers from top companies: [Google vs Apple vs Amazon vs Microsoft vs Oracle - Compare career levels across companies with Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Google,Apple,Amazon,Microsoft,Oracle&track=Software%20Engineer)
