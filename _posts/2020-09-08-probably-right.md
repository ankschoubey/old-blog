There is always a trade-off.

In every decision you make, there may be points in which you think the decision is right. And there are points where the same decisions are bad.

If you ask people for their opinion over something, each one of them will say slightly different thing.

The opinion isn’t enough, you got to dig for reasoning.

Reasoning over an opinion for a lot of people is not developed. Most choose an opinion because it is popular or because their friends and family have a similar opinion.

For those that you find have those own reasoning, these are interesting people.

A good founder listens to everyone then does what he wants to do.

Sometimes the decision is just a lack of information at the time. I would guess most of us would want to make optimal decisions all the time. But as humans we have our shortcoming and everyone is trying to do their best with information they have.
