Conventional message allow for adding cleaner git commit logs.

There are a few benefits to this:
- Conventional messages force developer to think clearly about what they are going to commit

I would recommend start with a list of commit messages you intend to put.

Then start coding.

Also, there are plugins available that would allow generating changelog files and auto implement semantic versioning.

Changelog are important as they make writing release notes easier.

Conventional commit messages can be re-enforced using pre-commit hooks.
