In a previous blogpost, I tried to explain why defining your core values are essential. These are some of my core values.

I want things to be as "sorted" as possible without being super involved. Hopefully in this post, you'll find some ways to have things sorted. 

1. Responsibility
2. Nirwana/Peace
3. Telling the Truth and being hyper realistic.
4. Systems Thinking
5. Inputs Matter
6. Time Matter

***

## Responsibility

Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities volentarily and facing your fears, you'll avoid being nihilistic. 

So, pick the heaviest weight you can take on and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then atleast when you are about the despare you can think "Dumb as I am, I can atleast push a thing from point A to point B". [^1]

Taking on responsibility volentarity/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you'll have your life sorted.

## Nirwana/Peace

Happiness/Peace is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make [^2]. You can choose to live certain way that will lead to peace.

You need to be peaceful if you want things to be good long term. Useful skills to develop here are detachment aka not wanting and being less judgemental. Aiming for peace, requires a lot of rethinking and flipping almost everything. 

If you don't believe that you can achieve ultimate peace "Nirwana", you'll have a heard time finding it.

## Telling the truth and being hyper realistic

Lying/Not telling the truth is the quickist way to hell. You base your decisions on what you persive reality to be.

If your estimate of the world is wrong, you'll make wrong decisions.

The only way to tell the truth and to be hyper realistic is to let go of the outcome and to assume that whatever happens in truth is the best thing that can happen.

## Systems Thinking

Aisms are good for setting up initial direction. But systems/processes is how you work towards them and beyond them.

Systems allows you to free up your mental RAM. Systems breaks problems down and assures that as long at the systems are working right, the direction is right.

Systems can include by are not limited to: trained habits, routines, frameworks, automations, etc.

## Inputs Matter

You are what you feed yourself. Inputs matter because not only do they encourage certain behaviors, but they impact your everyday experience.

Over the long term you want "inputs" in your life to push yourself in a certain direction.

Some things that can be considered in this are:
- Information you consume.
- People you interact with.
- Where and how you live. (#cleanYourRoom)

## Time Matters

Life is short. Speed of implementation matters a lot. Being impatient can be a good thing.

Be impatient with yourself and a bit patient with others.
