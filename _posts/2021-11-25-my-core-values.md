In a [previous blog post](/core-values), I tried to explain why defining your core values is essential. These are some of my core values. I have modified these multiple times.

I want things to be as "sorted" in the long term as possible without being super involved. I do not compromise on my values. They are my best bet. In this post, you'll find some ways to have things sorted. 

1. Responsibility
2. Nirwana/Peace
3. Telling the Truth and being hyper-realistic.
4. Systems Thinking
5. Inputs Matter
6. Time Matter
7. Courage is calling
8. Team Work

***

## Responsibility

Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities voluntarily and facing your fears, you'll avoid being nihilistic. 

So, pick the heaviest weight you can take and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then at least you can know, "Dumb as I am, I can at least push a thing from point A to point B" [^1]

Taking on responsibility voluntarily/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you'll have your life sorted.

**Role Models**:  Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), Jordan Peterson

## Nirwana/Peace

Being unhappy is inefficient.

Happiness/Peace is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make [^2]. You can choose to live a certain way that will lead to peace.

To have peace, your brain should be in controll in every situation. You have to be mentally tough. 

You need to be peaceful if you want things to be good long term. Develop detachment (not wanting), be less judgemental and optimism. Aiming for peace requires a lot of recognizing, rethinking and flipping/unlearing almost everything.

If you don't believe that you can achieve ultimate peace (Nirwana), you'll have a hard time finding it.

**Role Models**:  Naval Ravikant, Sam Harris, Kapil Gupta, Sadhguru

## Telling the truth and being hyper-realistic

Lying/Not telling the truth is the quickest way to hell. You base your decisions on what you perceive reality to be.

If your estimate of the world is wrong, you'll make bad decisions.

The only way is to let go of the outcome and to assume that whatever happens in truth is the best thing that can happen.

While dealing with people, you have to ask people multiple times to make sure they tell you everything because often humans tell white lies to not hurt your feelings.

**Role Models**: Naval Ravikant, Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, Kapil Gupta, Mark Manson

## Systems Thinking

Aims are good for setting up initial direction. But systems/processes are how you work towards them and beyond them.

Systems allow you to free up your mental RAM. Systems break problems down. They assure that as long as the systems are working right, the direction is right.

Systems can include by are not limited to: trained habits, routines, frameworks, automation, etc.

**Role Models**: Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, James Clear, Mark Manson, Ramit Sethi, Tim Ferriss, Naval Ravikant, Josh Kaufman

## Inputs Matter

You are what you feed yourself. Inputs matter because not only do they encourage certain behaviors, but they impact your everyday experience.

Over the long term, you want "inputs" in your life to push yourself in the desired direction.

Some things to consider:
- Information you consume.
- People you interact with regularly.
- Where and how you live. (#cleanYourRoom)

## Time Matters

Time is the most precious finite resource we have. We should make good use of it. If we do, we make time our ally.

Like any resource, one can think of time in numeric terms. This allows us to categorize activities as assets which add back time or liabilities, which take time away. Our goal essentially then is to create more time-assets with high time-ROI.

80% of more of our activities during a given day is not new. They are merely habits that have been repeated.

So essentially, by carefully observing, choosing and forming our habits would lead to more **time-assets** and less **time-liabilities**. Usually, time-assets and time-liabilities are opposites of each other.

Most time-liabilities snap our attention and lead us to caring about wrong things. Therefore, time-assets help us course correct. Therefore, time management is essentially attention management.

Some of the most impactful time-aseets and liabilities are:

| **Planning**: Even a little bit of planning, something like 10 minutes alone creating a written plan could save hours, days or even years. <br><br>Planning allows course correction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Rushing**: Though it may seem you are making progress. The probability is higher that you are moving in the wrong direction. It's better to fix a plan |

| **5 Min Rule**: Don't allow yourself to be down or procrastinate for more than 5 minutes. <br><br>During such time ask yourself: Is this worth the return on my time?<br><br>Remember you can't live forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Forever Rule: **The opposite of 5 min rule**: Letting fear/laziness/indecision stop you.                                                                 |
| **WIP Limit**: Focus on a few things and complete them. If your WIP limit is reached, don't add work on newer tasks unless older ones are complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Trying to change people**: You cannot change people. You can suggest but cannot force. Leading by example. It's the best option you have.              |
| **Pomodoro**: Working in Pomodoros keeps you focused. If you can't work with pomodoro, you haven't planned carefully enough.<br><br>To have pomodoro sessions.<br>1. Create a distraction free zone.<br>2. Plan your tasks<br>3. Put on headphones and play instrumental/[focus music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx65qkgCWNJIs3FPaj8JZhduXSpQ_ZfvL).<br>4. Work on the task using [a Pomodoro app](https://pomofocus.io/).<br>5. Stick to break schedule religiously. Get away from the room during break but no internet. |                                                                                                                                                          |

During normal decision making, one can calculate ROI of their actions: think about how much time you'll invest and how much return you'll get back.

## Courage is calling [^3]

This is probably the most important value that supports all others. It takes courage to tell the truth, act responsibly, detach yourself to be peaceful, build and trusting long term systems, and break the spell of wasting time. And the courage of following the plan and push yourself when time comes. 

Everything worth while is an act of courage.

No one is invincible. It's good and courageous to be vulnerable. To admit to faults and take steps to improve it but it's not okay to be weak.

Courage is exciting. It pushes to act beyond what one believes is possible. So get excited by the challenge and push yourself beyond what you think is possible.

**Role Models**: Jocko Willink, Super Saiyan Blue - Son Goku, Bounce Man - Monkey D Luffy, Byan Mode - Naruto, Batman

## Team Work

Humans are a social animal. We are node in a network[^1]. The way we act and interact in the network determines the life of everyone. 

We stand on the shoulders of all those who came before us. And we are building a foundation for all those who will come after.

Plus who are we doing all this "core-values" for if we can't even help and be there people around us. One cannot do it alone and it is worthless doing it alone.

There are multiple levels of "team work" and each requires a different approach.
- Everyone else
- Close Friends
- Family and Partner
- Children

This also requires a level of self awareness and knowing how your interaction/quality of relationships can be improved. 

One can be strict with himself but has to be patient with others. And remember that you are probably not right so listen to people carefully -> Openness.

I am trying make these values my second nature by forming habits. The ideal goal is identity level change [^4] but it will take time which is why I haven't published my post on it. You can read the draft version though: [My core habits](/core-habits).
