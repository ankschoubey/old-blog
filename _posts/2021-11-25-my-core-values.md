In a [previous blog post](/core-values), I tried to explain why defining your core values is essential. These are some of my core values. I have modified these multiple times.

I want things to be as "sorted" in the long term as possible without being super involved. I do not compromise on my values and try to actively practice them everyday. They are my best bet. 

Each and every opportunity to practice these values aren't just options, it's two different pathways. Things fall apart when I don't act virtously. The way I/someone pays for their privilages is virtues.

1. Responsibility
2. Nirwana/Peace
3. Telling the Truth and being hyper-realistic.
4. Systems Thinking
5. Inputs Matter
6. Time Matter
7. Courage is calling
8. Team Work

## How this post is structured?

In each of the value I try to:
1. Explain the goal of having the value
2. Some 80/20 rules that surround the value
3. Systems that can make forming habit around the value second nature.
4. Resources, Books and Role Models 
5. Examples that help solidify

***

## **Responsibility**: It's not worth having ego but no one will save you.

Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities voluntarily and facing your fears, you'll avoid being nihilistic. 

So, pick the heaviest weight you can take and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then at least you can know, "Dumb as I am, I can at least push a thing from point A to point B" [^1]

Taking on responsibility voluntarily/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you'll have your life sorted.

**Role Models**:  Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), Jordan Peterson

**How responsibility effects others values?**

| Influencing Values | - | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Team Work, Systems and Inputs | **Look your best** | Team Work: It's respectful to you and to the other person if you look and present your best. Dress right all the time. Be Hygenic. Get your hair in shape at end of every month.<br><br><br>System & Inputs: Clothing influences performance and cognition. |
| Team Work, Peace | Be fun and disciplined the same time | Be the most fun person for others. Extremely fun. Be the most practical and disciplined person for yourself.<br><br>This is perfect balance. Similar to learn to build and learn to sell. If you can do both, you'll be unstoppable.<br><br>Jocko Podcast can be good place to emulate |
| Peace, Time and Courage | Be depressed for a minute. Then move on. | You have responsibilities to take care of. |
| Team Work and Peace |  | Healthy relationship starts with healthy relationship with yourself. If you don't value your thoughts and feeling straight with yourself. You will toletate other people mis. You got shit to straight. Work on your trauma. |
| Team Work |  | The worst feeling is that you are not enough for your family, friends and your job. |
| Team Work | Choosing the right people | Your responsibility is more towards people who make time for you than people who don't.<br><br>And it's a good thing, not a selfish thing to choose people who are good for you. |
| Systems |  | You don't have to worry about the results. you just have to worry about inputs.<br>Karm karo. Fal ki chinta karne ki zarurat nahi. |

## **Nirwana/Peace**: Don't suffer imagined troubles

Being unhappy is inefficient.

Happiness/Peace is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make [^2]. You can choose to live a certain way that will lead to peace.

To have peace, your brain should be in controll in every situation. You have to be mentally tough. 

You need to be peaceful if you want things to be good long term. Develop detachment (not wanting), be less judgemental and optimism. Aiming for peace requires a lot of recognizing, rethinking and flipping/unlearing almost everything.

If you don't believe that you can achieve ultimate peace (Nirwana), you'll have a hard time finding it.

**Role Models**:  Naval Ravikant, Sam Harris, Kapil Gupta, Sadhguru

## **Truth**: Unhide the fog by becoming truth seeking missile. 

Humans aren't rational creatures because we cannot understand or have information about everything at once.

Since we base our decisions on our perceived reality, it is very important to our perceived reality match original reality.

There are a few sub paths within the relm of truth:
1. Seeking truth
2. Accepting truth
3. Always saying truth
4. Always activing truthfully.


Truth can feel random. But we can create a habit/series of step to follow to ensure we are as truthful as possible.

Truthful speech has following features:
- Before telling the truth to others. Let go of your identity. Deliver truth to yourself completely. This can be something you don't want but you know it exactly.
- Be as specific as possible. Being wage means you aren't speaking the truth.
- Test out the truth quickly. Truths are not based on assumptions. Depending on the context either the truth will be a past event, in which can you could recall the past event exactly. Or a feeling, in which case one has to really listen to himself.
- Accept the truth and let go. Don't over rationalize after one point. 



The only way is to let go of the outcome and to assume that whatever happens in truth is the best thing that can happen.

While dealing with people, you have to ask people multiple times to make sure they tell you everything because often humans tell white lies to not hurt your feelings.

## **Systems Thinking**: Become an effortness executioner - 'Everthing is undercontrol'

Aims are good for setting up initial direction. But systems/processes are how you work towards them and beyond them.

Systems allow you to free up your mental RAM. Systems break problems down. They assure that as long as the systems are working right, the direction is right.

Systems can include by are not limited to: trained habits, routines, frameworks, automation, etc.

The goal with systems is to keep them up most of the time. Perfect streak may not be possible unless human component is removed.

Most important systems are habits because they impact our day to day. These are most impactful systems one can have.

## **Inputs Matter**: Catelist

You are what you feed yourself. Inputs matter because not only do they encourage certain behaviors, but they impact your everyday experience.

Over the long term, you want "inputs" in your life to push yourself in the desired direction. The quality and quantity of inputs are very dependent on stage of progress and incoming of opportunities.

All inputs have to be filtered

Some things to consider:
- Information you consume.
- People you interact with regularly.
- Where and how you live. (#cleanYourRoom)

## **Time Matters**: You don't have forever

Time is the most precious finite resource we have. We should make good use of it. If we do, we make time our ally.

Like any resource, one can think of time in numeric terms. This allows us to categorize activities as assets which add back time or liabilities, which take time away. Our goal essentially then is to create more time-assets with high time-ROI.

80% of more of our activities during a given day is not new. They are merely habits that have been repeated.

So essentially, by carefully observing, choosing and forming our habits would lead to more **time-assets** and less **time-liabilities**. Usually, time-assets and time-liabilities are opposites of each other.

Most time-liabilities snap our attention and lead us to caring about wrong things. Therefore, time-assets help us course correct. Therefore, time management is essentially attention management.

Some of the most impactful time-aseets and liabilities are:

| Time-Assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Time Liabilities                                                                                                                                         |

| **Planning**: Even a little bit of planning, something like 10 minutes alone creating a written plan could save hours, days or even years. <br><br>Planning allows course correction. Ideally, don't start working without a plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Rushing**: Though it may seem you are making progress. The probability is higher that you are moving in the wrong direction. It's better to fix a plan |
| **Meditation**:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Instagram**                                                                                                                                            |
| **5 Min Rule**: Don't allow yourself to be down or procrastinate for more than 5 minutes. <br><br>During such time ask yourself: Is this worth the return on my time?<br><br>Remember you can't live forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Forever Rule: **The opposite of 5 min rule**: Letting fear/laziness/indecision stop you.                                                                 |
| **WIP Limit**: Focus on a few things and complete them. If your WIP limit is reached, don't add work on newer tasks unless older ones are complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Trying to change people**: You cannot change people. You can suggest but cannot force. Leading by example. It's the best option you have.              |
| **Pomodoro**: Working in Pomodoros keeps you focused. If you can't work with pomodoro, you haven't planned carefully enough.<br><br>To have pomodoro sessions.<br>1. Create a distraction free zone.<br>2. Plan your tasks. Ideally pick a deliverable.<br>3. Put on headphones and play instrumental/[focus music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx65qkgCWNJIs3FPaj8JZhduXSpQ_ZfvL).<br>4. Work on the task using [a Pomodoro app](https://pomofocus.io/).<br>5. Stick to break schedule religiously. Get away from the room during break but no internet. <br><br>One pomodoro is better than zero pomodoro. |                                                                                                                                                          |

During normal decision making, one can calculate ROI of their actions: think about how much time you'll invest and how much return you'll get back.

## **Courage is calling**: Be unstoppable. Break limits.
[^3]

This is probably the most important value that supports all others. It takes courage to tell the truth, act responsibly, detach yourself to be peaceful, build and trusting long term systems, and break the spell of wasting time. And the courage of following the plan and push yourself when time comes. 

Everything worth while is an act of courage.

No one is invincible. It's good and courageous to be vulnerable. To admit to faults and take steps to improve it but it's not okay to be weak.

Courage is exciting. It pushes to act beyond what one believes is possible. So get excited by the challenge and push yourself beyond what you think is possible.

**Role Models**: Jocko Willink, Super Saiyan Blue - Son Goku, Bounce Man - Monkey D Luffy, Byan Mode - Naruto, Batman, James Bond

## **Team Work**: Treat others like you want to be treated

Humans are a social animal. We are node in a network[^1]. The way we act and interact in the network determines the life of everyone. 

We stand on the shoulders of all those who came before us. And we are building a foundation for all those who will come after.

Plus who are we doing all this "core-values" for if we can't even help and be there people around us. One cannot do it alone and it is worthless doing it alone.

There are multiple levels of "team work" and each requires a different approach.
- Everyone else
- Close Friends
- Family and Partner
- Children

This also requires a level of self awareness and knowing how your interaction/quality of relationships can be improved. 

One can be strict with himself but has to be patient with others. And remember that you are probably not right so listen to people carefully -> Openness.

I am trying make these values my second nature by forming habits. The ideal goal is identity level change [^4] but it will take time which is why I haven't published my post on it. You can read the draft version though: [My core habits](/core-habits).
