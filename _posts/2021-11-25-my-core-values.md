In a [previous blog post](/core-values), I tried to explain why defining your core values is essential. These are some of my core values designed around my strengths and flaws. I have modified these multiple times.

I want things to be as "sorted" in the long term as possible without being super involved. I do not compromise on my values. They are my best bet. In this post, you'll find some ways to have things sorted. 

***

## **Responsibility**: It's not worth having ego but no one will save you.

> What emerges from lack of responsibility is chaos

> Turn the obstacles up side down.

> Start by cleaning up your room

> Begin with the end in mind.

> Put first things first.

> With great responsibility comes great power.

Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities voluntarily and facing your fears, you'll avoid being nihilistic. 

So, pick the heaviest weight you can take and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then at least you can know, "Dumb as I am, I can at least push a thing from point A to point B" [^1]

Taking on responsibility voluntarily/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you'll have your life sorted.

Many times it's not our fault, but it's our responsibility.

**Role Models**:  Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), Jordan Peterson

## **Nirwana/Peace**: Don't suffer imagined troubles

> Happiness is a single player game. It is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make.

> All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.

> Not wanting something is as good as having it.

> **The Backwards Law**: Pursuing positive experience is a negative experience and accepting negative experience itself is a positive experience.

Being unhappy is inefficient.

Happiness/Peace is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make [^2]. You can choose to live a certain way that will lead to peace.

To have peace, your brain should be in controll in every situation. You have to be mentally tough. 

You need to be peaceful if you want things to be good long term. Develop detachment (not wanting), be less judgemental and optimism. Aiming for peace requires a lot of recognizing, rethinking and flipping/unlearing almost everything.

If you don't believe that you can achieve ultimate peace (Nirwana), you'll have a hard time finding it.

**Role Models**:  Naval Ravikant, Sam Harris, Kapil Gupta, Sadhguru

**Books**: Subtle at of not giving a fuck by Mark Manson

**FOR**:

- Internal Locus of Control
- Optimism

## **Truth**: Unhide the fog by becoming truth seeking missile. 

> Everything thatâ€™s best happens in truth. If it isnâ€™t truth, then it isnâ€™t the best.

> If you donâ€™t know what to do, tell the truth.

Lying/Not telling the truth is the quickest way to hell. You base your decisions on what you perceive reality to be.

If your estimate of the world is wrong, you'll make bad decisions.

The only way is to let go of the outcome and to assume that whatever happens in truth is the best thing that can happen.

While dealing with people, you have to ask people multiple times to make sure they tell you everything because often humans tell white lies to not hurt your feelings.

**Role Models**: Naval Ravikant, Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, Kapil Gupta, Mark Manson

**Books**: Lying by Sam Harris

**FOR**:

- Authenticity: Being the same person when no one is watching.
- Integrity: the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles. Being whole and undivided.
- Verbalize Thoughts

**AGAINST**:

- Lieing
- Deception
- Hiding truth for short term gain

## **Systems**: Become an effortness executioner - 'Everthing is undercontrol'

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

> Rome wasnâ€™t built in a day

> Direction and long-term consistency are better than shortcuts.

Aims are good for setting up initial direction. But systems/processes are how you work towards them and beyond them.

Systems allow you to free up your mental RAM. Systems break problems down. They assure that as long as the systems are working right, the direction is right.

Systems can include by are not limited to: trained habits, routines, frameworks, automation, etc.

**Role Models**: Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, James Clear, Mark Manson, Ramit Sethi, Tim Ferriss, Naval Ravikant, Josh Kaufman

**Books**: Atomic Habits by James Clear

**FOR**:

- Do-Something

## **Inputs**: Focus of an eagle

> If more information was the answer, weâ€™d all be billionaires with perfect abs

> If you donâ€™t have attention, you donâ€™t have time.

> Less is more

> Pay stupid games. Win stupid prices.

You are what you feed yourself. Inputs matter because not only do they encourage certain behaviors, but they impact your everyday experience.

Over the long term, you want "inputs" in your life to push yourself in the desired direction.

Some things to consider:
- Information you consume.
- People you interact with regularly.
- Where and how you live. (#cleanYourRoom)

**Role Models**: Ryan Holiday

**Books**: Subtle at of not giving a fuck by Mark Manson, Stillness by Ryan Holiday

## **Time**: You don't have forever

> Itâ€™s not that we have a short time to live but we waste a lot of it

> Being busy is a form of laziness.

We have a finite life. Though it is long enough to get important things done.

Your habits are reenforced. If you waste time regularly, youâ€™ll continue to waste time.

Letâ€™s suppose your time is worth minimum wage.
Assume that to be 100Rs per hour. Letâ€™s suppose you waste 6 hours a day. Thatâ€™s 600Rs per day. 1,80,000 lakh rs per month. 21,60,000 rs per year. Over 10 years itâ€™s 2 crore rs.

Plus this calculation ðŸ§® excludes compounding. Time spent early will compound.

Life is short. Speed of implementation matters a lot. Being impatient can be a good thing.

Be impatient with yourself and a bit patient with others.

**Role Models**: Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, Ryan Holiday, Cal Newport

**FOR**:

- Planning every hour of the day
- Reducing context switching by Monotasking and Batch processing.

**AGAINST**:

- Lying in bed all day
- Addictions
- Social Approval
- Status Game

## **Courage is calling**: The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.

> If you have to slay a dragon, you should go to it's lair before it comes to your village.

> The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.

Courage is proper action despite not being fully ready. If you are given an opportunity to be courageous, you are already prepared.

This is probably the most important value that supports all others. It takes courage to tell the truth, act responsibly, detach yourself to be peaceful, build and trusting long term systems, and break the spell of wasting time. And the courage of following the plan and push yourself when time comes. 

Everything worth while is an act of courage.

No one is invincible. It's good and courageous to be vulnerable. To admit to faults and take steps to improve it but it's not okay to be weak.

Courage is exciting. It pushes to act beyond what one believes is possible. So get excited by the challenge and push yourself beyond what you think is possible.

**Role Models**: Jocko Willink, Super Saiyan Blue - Son Goku, Bounce Man - Monkey D Luffy, Byan Mode - Naruto, Batman

**Books**: Courage is Calling by Ryan Holiday

**FOR**:

- Take a little step outside your comfort zone.
- Embrace change.
- New experiences

**AGAINST**:

- Excessive Flinch

## **Team Work**: Node in a network

> Treat others like you want to be treated

> Seek to understand. Then to be understood.

Humans are a social animal. We are node in a network[^1]. The way we act and interact in the network determines the life of everyone. 

We stand on the shoulders of all those who came before us. And we are building a foundation for all those who will come after.

Plus who are we doing all this "core-values" for if we can't even help and be there people around us. One cannot do it alone and it is worthless doing it alone.

There are multiple levels of "team work" and each requires a different approach.
- Everyone else
- Close Friends
- Family and Partner

This also requires a level of self awareness and knowing how your interaction/quality of relationships can be improved. 

One can be strict with himself but has to be patient with others. And remember that you are probably not right so listen to people carefully -> Openness.

**Role Models**: Avengers, Straw Hat Crew (One Piece), Jura Tempest Federation (That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime), Some family related parts of Peaky Blinders

**FOR**:

- Trust
- Care
- Seek to understand then to be understood
- Think Win-Win

**AGAINST**:

- Drama Triangle
- Betrayal

## **Rational Behaviour**: Real wisdom is an action

> Delay Gratification. Choose long-term over short-term.

> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.

Humans are biased. We are emotional creatures. This can be a good thing and a bad thing.

Rationality allows for a next level thinking where decisions can be made from a birds ðŸ¦… eye view and while knowing the long term effects.

Almost all rationality leads to long term thinking.

Rational Thinking is precursor to rational behavior. But rational behavior should also be practiced explicitly.

Rationality has 2 parts: Emotions + Logic. The game is to understand and make best decision that satisfy both.

**Role Models**: Stoics

**FOR**:

- Detach: Think from an outsider's perspective. Like you are giving advice to someone else
    - If this was for someone I know, what would I advice them? Often this advice would be different and more rational.

**AGAINST**:

- Getting confused
- Not taking action
- Being Myopic
- Vindictive
- Emotional

I am trying make these values my second nature by forming habits. The ideal goal is identity level change [^4] but it will take time which is why I haven't published my post on it.
