In a [previous blog post](/core-values), I tried to explain why defining your core values is essential. These are some of my core values. I have modified these multiple times.

I want things to be as "sorted" as possible without being super involved. In this post, you'll find some ways to have things sorted. 

1. Responsibility
2. Nirwana/Peace
3. Telling the Truth and being hyper-realistic.
4. Systems Thinking
5. Inputs Matter
6. Time Matter
7. Courage is calling

## Responsibility

Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities voluntarily and facing your fears, you'll avoid being nihilistic. 

So, pick the heaviest weight you can take and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then at least you can know, "Dumb as I am, I can at least push a thing from point A to point B" [^1]

Taking on responsibility voluntarily/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you'll have your life sorted.

Paragons: Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield)

## Nirwana/Peace

Being unhappy is inefficient.

Happiness/Peace is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make [^2]. You can choose to live a certain way that will lead to peace.

You need to be peaceful if you want things to be good long term. Develop detachment (not wanting) and be less judgemental. Aiming for peace requires a lot of rethinking and flipping almost everything.

If you don't believe that you can achieve ultimate peace (Nirwana), you'll have a hard time finding it.

## Telling the truth and being hyper-realistic

Lying/Not telling the truth is the quickest way to hell. You base your decisions on what you perceive reality to be.

If your estimate of the world is wrong, you'll make bad decisions.

The only way is to let go of the outcome and to assume that whatever happens in truth is the best thing that can happen.

While dealing with people, you have to ask people multiple times to make sure they tell you everything because often humans tell white lies to not hurt your feelings.

Paragons: Naval Ravikant, Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, Kapil Gupta

## Systems Thinking

Aims are good for setting up initial direction. But systems/processes are how you work towards them and beyond them.

Systems allow you to free up your mental RAM. Systems break problems down. They assure that as long as the systems are working right, the direction is right.

Systems can include by are not limited to: trained habits, routines, frameworks, automation, etc.

Paragons: Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson

## Inputs Matter

You are what you feed yourself. Inputs matter because not only do they encourage certain behaviors, but they impact your everyday experience.

Over the long term, you want "inputs" in your life to push yourself in the desired direction.

Some things to consider:
- Information you consume.
- People you interact with regularly.
- Where and how you live. (#cleanYourRoom)

Paragons: Ryan Holiday

## Time Matters

We have a finite life. Though it is long enough to get important things done.

Your habits are reenforced. If you waste time regularly, youâ€™ll continue to waste time.

Letâ€™s suppose your time is worth minimum wage.
Assume that to be 100Rs per hour. Letâ€™s suppose you waste 6 hours a day. Thatâ€™s 600Rs per day. 1,80,000 lakh rs per month. 21,60,000 rs per year. Over 10 years itâ€™s 2 crore rs.

Plus this calculation ðŸ§® excludes compounding. Time spent early will compound.

Life is short. Speed of implementation matters a lot. Being impatient can be a good thing.

Be impatient with yourself and a bit patient with others.

Paragons: Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson

## Courage is calling [^3]

This is probably the most important value that supports all others. It takes courage to tell the truth, act responsibly, detach yourself to be peaceful, build and trusting long term systems, and break the spell of wasting time. And the courage of following the plan and push yourself when time comes. 

Everything worth while is an act of courage.
