In a previous blogpost, I tried to explain why defining your core values are essential. These are some of my core values.

I want things to be as "sorted" as possible without being super involved. Hopefully in this post, you'll find some ways to have things sorted. 

1. Responsibility
2. Nirwana/Peace
3. Telling the Truth and being hyper realistic.
4. Systems Thinking
5. Inputs Matter
6. Time Matter

## Responsibility

Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities volentarily and facing your fears, you'll avoid being nihilistic. 

So, pick the heaviest weight you can take on and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then atleast when you are about the despare you can think "Dumb as I am, I can atleast push a thing from point A to point B". [^1]

Taking on responsibility volentarity/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you'll have your life sorted.

## Nirwana/Peace

Happiness/Peace is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make [^2]. You can choose to live certain way that will lead to peace.

You need to be peaceful if you want things to be good long term. Useful skills to develop here are detachment aka not wanting and being less judgemental. Aiming for peace, requires a lot of rethinking and flipping almost everything. 

If you don't believe that you can achieve ultimate peace "Nirwana", you'll have a heard time finding it.

## Telling the truth and being hyper realistic

Lying/Not telling the truth is the quickist way to hell. You base your decisions on what you persive reality to be.

If your estimate of the world is wrong, you'll make wrong decisions.
