In a previous blogpost, I tried to explain why defining your core values are essential. These are some of my core values.

I want things to be as "sorted" as possible without being super involved. Hopefully in this post, you'll find some ways to have things sorted. 

1. Responsibility
2. Nirwana/Peace
3. Telling the Truth and being hyper realistic.
4. Systems Thinking
5. Inputs Matter
6. Time Matter

# Responsibility

Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities volentarily and facing your fears, you'll avoid being nihilistic. 

So, pick the heaviest weight you can take on and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then atleast when you are about the despare you can think "Dumb as I am, I can atleast push a thing from point A to point B". [^1]

Taking on responsibility volentarity/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you'll have your life sorted.
