I have been wondering over such questions a lot lately. 

## Ethics

Ethics is kind of hard to define. Objectively, it is a myth. Often a shared myth.

For the sake of this post, let's reduce ethics to: 
- Not doing wrong things that you know are wrong.

Ethics is a kind of myth. Often a shared myth.

## Meaning
Ethics provide life more meaning.

A meaningful life is more exciting and fullfiling compared to the other.

## Not being corrupt

So that your mind isn't corrupt when facing challenges in life.

So that you can be sane and act well when faced with bad or evil and not make things worse.

## The price you pay not being ethical

Your habits and actions are proofs to yourself of the kind of person you are. [^1]

The direction of things are more important than the speed at which you achieve them. Because if you are being corrupt is a minute way, you put a proof to yourself that you are corrupt.

If you take the same behavior and streach it to a lifetime, you will likely be in a very different place to where you are.

## Long Term Greedy

Ethics is being greedy long term. (But very long term)

The hallmark of any compounding process is short term pain for long term reward.

## Being ethical means you have nothing to hide.

Being ethical means you can tell the truth almost always and not be afraid of the consiquenses.
