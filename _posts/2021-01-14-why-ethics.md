I have been wondering over such questions a lot lately.

I don't have concrete thoughts formed over this yet.

Ethics extends from personal to even business decisions (like data privacy).

## Ethics

Ethics is kind of hard to define. Objectively, it is a myth, a shared myth [^4].

For the sake of this post, let's reduce ethics to:
- Not doing wrong things that you know are wrong.
  
## Not being corrupt

One should be ethical so that the mind isn't corrupt when facing challenges in life [^3].

So that you can be sane and act well when faced with bad or evil and not make things worse.

## Reducing decision fatigue

A side effect of being ethical is that you'll have fewer decisions to make as you can easily eliminate not ethical decisions.

## The price you pay not being ethical

Your habits and actions are proofs to yourself of the kind of person you are. [^1]

The direction of things is more important than the speed at which you achieve them. Because if you are being corrupt in a tiny way, you put proof to yourself that you are corrupt.

If you take the same behaviour and stretch it to a lifetime, you will likely be in a very different place to where you are.

## Long Term Greedy [^2]

Ethics is being greedy long term. (But very long term.)

The hallmark of any compounding process is short term pain for long term reward.

## Having nothing to hide. [^2] [^3]

Being ethical allows you to tell the truth almost always and not be afraid of the consequences. 

## Meaning
Ethics provide life more meaning.

A meaningful life is more exciting and fulfilling compared to the other.

## Ethics is something you practice and not just something you learn [^2]

## Node in a network

Your actions and decisions are more than yours. They are a node in a network [^3]. If you can affect 1000 people whom you positively meet in your life, they might do that same to other people and positive things branch out like a tree.
