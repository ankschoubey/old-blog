I have been wondering over this lately. I don't have concrete thoughts formed yet.

Ethics extends from personal to even business decisions (like data privacy).

## Ethics

Ethics is hard to define. Objectively, it is a myth, a shared myth [^4].

For the sake of this post, let's reduce ethics to:
- Not doing wrong things that you know are wrong.
  
## Not being corrupt

One should be ethical so that once's mind isn't corrupt when facing life's challenges [^3].

So that once can act sane and not make things worse.

## Reducing decision fatigue

A side effect of being ethical is that you'll have fewer decisions to make. You can instantly eliminate un-ethical once.

## The price you pay not being ethical

Your habits and actions are proofs to yourself of the kind of person you are. [^1]

If you take the same behaviour and stretch it to a lifetime, you will likely be in a very different place to where you are.

The direction of things is more important than the speed at which you achieve them because you could end up in a very different place. 

## Long Term Greedy [^2]

Being ethical is being greedy long term.

The hallmark of any compounding process is short term pain for long term reward.

For example: If people know you are ethical, they trust you more. They'll be more likely to do deals through you. [^2]

Example 2: If you are ethical, you are surrounded by ethical people. [^2]

Being ethical includes a lot of short term pain for a future reward.

## Having nothing to hide. [^2] [^3]

Being ethical allows you to tell the truth almost always and not be afraid of the consequences. 

## Node in a network

Your actions and decisions are more than yours. They are a ripple in a network [^3].

If you can affect 1000 people positively, they might do that same to other people. Positive things branch out like a tree.

## Meaning
Ethics provide life more meaning.

A meaningful life is more exciting and fulfilling.

## Ethics is something you practice and not just something you learn [^2]
