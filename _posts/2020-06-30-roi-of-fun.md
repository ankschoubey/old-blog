## Hobbies
Hobbies are weird in the sense that after an initial interest in doing it we start expecting too much from it.

Each next creation becomes a race to be better than the previous one.

Every-time you show something you cooked or something you made... the first reaction from people is... why don't you open a business??

> No! this is something I do for fun...

There is no real ROI! I don't want to be famous or make money with this.

Life requires activities that have no other purpose than the joy that activities itself provides.[^1]

If suddenly there is an expected ROI attached it has a probability of not being fun anymore. Though the **result of having an ROI is the quality and quantity of output increases a lot**.
