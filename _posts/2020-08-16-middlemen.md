Middlemen companies are weird.

They provide services from one company to either another company or to consumers. 

Some example of middlemen services are
- Stripe
- Car Dealers
- Mobile Wallets
- Food Delivery Services
- Ride Sharing Apps
- Most online e-commerce website

The reason middlemen are able to operate is because the source company is too complex for most normal people or companies to understand. So they make it convenient for people.

But this also is risky if source company can easily provide the facility themself. Then there is no need of middleman.

Like when Tesla decided to not sell their cars through dealership.

Middleman companies sometimes act as affiliate.
- The source company deals with creating the product.
- The middlemen deal with selling the product.
