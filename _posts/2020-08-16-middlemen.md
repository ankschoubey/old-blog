Middlemen companies provide services from one company to either another company or to consumers. 

## Examples
- Stripe
- Car Dealers
- Mobile Wallets
- Food Delivery Services
- Ride-Sharing Apps
- Most online e-commerce website

## The Business
The reason middlemen can operate is that the source company is too complex for most normal people or companies to understand.

So they make it convenient for people.

## Risk
But this also is risky if the source company can easily provide the facility themself. Then there is no need for a middleman.

Like when Tesla decided to not sell their cars through a dealership.

Middleman companies in a way act as an affiliate.
- The source company deals with creating the product.
- The middlemen deal with selling the product.
