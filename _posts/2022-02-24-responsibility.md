1. Take full responsibility for yourself.

2. Taking responsibility is a choice you make in every moment.

3. You aren't obligated to take responsibility for others. But you should guide them or at least be so responsible that you lead by example.

4. If someone gives you responsibility, take it.

specific examples: if your boss,family,partner by themselves are giving you respo. It means they think you are ready for it or ready for growth. take it and fullfil it to it’s best

5. Important: Start with local problems that repeat. Don't try to solve something that isn't even a problem of high ROI.
