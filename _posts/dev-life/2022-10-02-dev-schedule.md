# It’s best to divide the day into pre-lunch.

Post lunch. This provides a natural break.

Prelunch. You want to do core development work on your story.

Post development you want to pair up with someone. Ask what they are doing. Help them out.

For most daily scrum, is morning. Before this should be a planning phase. Ideally. Then you can throw away the plan.

# When to find time to learn.

In between work, if you want to implement something, it’s best to learn about it. 

For example: 
1. You want to flatten a tree. You probably know how to do it, but you haven’t implemented it before. And this is the production code. So it’s best to spend 10-20 minutes learning. You might find something new. This exploration time ideally shouldn’t be greater than an hour.

You could also take 1 hour or workday.
