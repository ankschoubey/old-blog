Disclaimer: I haven't developed an extremely complete plugin architecture myself. What I have developed is a plugin architecture which is robust enough. There are too many points to the discussion. These are all my thoughts.

## Identify places in your application which you want to provide as plugin

## Identify how plugin is going to share data? And can plugin update in real time? if Yes how?

For example: 1 Plugin can be of 2 parts.

How will P1 and P2 share data?

Ideally, these should be microservices?

Note: This is how slack and teams do it.

## Define interfaces that plugin developers can use

- Zapier allows using CLI to generate a project architecture
- They have specific interfaces that can be used for generating plugin
- They also have a z object that can be used for a limited set of features such as API calls.

## Keep your product as lean as possible

For plugin architecture, the whole product should be made pluggable. That is even first party features should be developed as plugin. Which means there will be almost nothing in the core.

You could have 2 interfaces for this.

1 for publish `pluginInterface`
2 for first hand `interface firstHand extends pluginInterface`

Or you could provide a limited set of components that can be rendered on UI.

The term interface and components are loose here. Many plugins are simply JSON based.

## You'll have to create infrastructure for managing plugins and plugin lifecycle

Something like

- Interfaces for plugins
- Plugin repository
  - How will you manage so many third party plugins?
  - How will plugin versions be managed?
- Approval process
  - This will also include manual approavls.
  - I would also add a virus scanner and other security measures.
