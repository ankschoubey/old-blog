title: You are really doing BDD when
---

You are really doing BDD if you answer yes to these questions:

- BDD specifications drive the design of VDIs, prioritization and development.
  - Specs first VDIs later.
  - Specs first Development later.

- Any new decision made about the product functionality leads to an updated spec file.
  - Therefore the spec file is an integral part of every meeting.

- Any dispute or confusion about what was decided is resolved by reviewing the spec file.

- You remember the specification files because you have read, modified and used them so much.

- Everyone involved in the product life cycle (including non-technical people) knows what BDD is and has access to spec file.

- When any new person who wants to understand the product is given the BDD file to understand it.
