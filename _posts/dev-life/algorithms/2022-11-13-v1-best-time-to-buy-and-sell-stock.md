## All Approaches and Explanations in English

### O(n) time complexity. O(1) space complexity

Make sure the left pointer is always the lowest yet. Keep checking the difference between left and right. And return max.

### Code, if any

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = 1;
        int maxYet = 0;
        while(right < prices.length){
            int leftItem = prices[left];
            int rightItem = prices[right];
            if(rightItem < leftItem){
                left = right;
                right = right+1;
                continue;
            }
            maxYet = Math.max(maxYet, rightItem - leftItem);
            right++;
        }
        return maxYet;
    }
}
```
