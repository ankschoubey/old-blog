In case you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebook, I recommend watching the following videos:

## Use Wild Card Import

`import *`

> In Jupyter Notebook where **you want to be able to quickly interactively** **try stuff out,** you don’t want to constantly going back up to the top and importing more stuff. You want to be able to use lots of tab complete and be very experimental, so `import *` is great.

> When you are building stuff in production, you can do the normal PEP8 style proper software engineering practices.

> This is a different style of coding. It’s not that there are no rules in data science programming, the rules are different.

## Types of Notebooks

It is best to consider 2 types of notebooks for your projects

1. Lab Notebooks

1. Delivery Notebooks

Lab Notebooks help in **trying stuff out** _without worrying_ **about making things every reproducible**. The goal is just to refer back to what was done in the past.

Delivery Notebooks are **‘production’ grade**, well **documented** and **reproducible** which can be shared with the entire team/client.

For Lab Notebook naming convention can be something like:

## Split code into multiple cells to get better code-completion

This is a no-brainer but I struggled with this for a long time.

Weakly typed programming languages like Python do not work well with code completions provided by IDEs because the type of value return by a function is defined at run-time. IDEs have a hard time figuring out what the return type is.

But when running Jupyter Notebook you can avoid this by splitting your code into multiple cells instead of one, running them one by one and then hitting `Tab`.

## Use _%time_ for measuring the rough speed of cell’s execution
