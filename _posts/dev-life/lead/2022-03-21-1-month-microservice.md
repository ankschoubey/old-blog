title: One Month Microservice
---

I aspire to build microservices/microfrontends and deploy to production within a month.

A microservice should not be super big. If it is, it's not micro anymore.

The idea with One Month Microservice is this. 

One month and a synchronized-3-man-squad is enough to code up a microservice and deploy to production.
- Assuming 3 weeks of coding.
- One week of deployment.

If it's takes more than 1 month the following may be reasons,
- Learning curve for the particular microservice is too high
- New Team
- Design could be improved
- Microservice infrastucture (chassis) is not in place.
- Team isn't a synchronized 3 man squad. aka it's too big with a lot of moving pieces.
