Often, we have multiple steps in reaching a piece of code to debug. For example, we’d set up infrastructure like doing an API call or setting up a database, Kafka, or something else.

A better way to debug is to [create a unit test](https://www.ankushchoubey.com/encounter-a-bug/) where you call your code with the same set of parameters you want to debug. Once your code is fixed, your test can stay for the future.

I usually keep a [template for these regression bug kinds of tests](https://www.ankushchoubey.com/v1/junit-bug-tracking).

For example, suppose I have an error in my MongoDB database. I know what database record causes the error. I can replicate this in the `@DataMongoTest` and validate it.

But assuming you have not written a unit test for debugging, there is another way to debug that doesn’t involve setting up the entire application infrastructure, and that’s to use ApplicationContext directly.

Using `ApplicationContext`, you can access any `@Bean` and call its method.

Here’s an example. (Don’t forget to put debug points)

```java
public static void main(String args[]){
  ApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(ClassName.class);
  while(true){ // often it would help if you debugged multiple times.
    try{
      ABeanYouWant bean = context.getBean(ABeanYouWant.class);
      String response = bean.methodOfTheBean("Parameter1", "Parameter2"); // DEBUG POINT
      System.out.println("response");// DEBUG POINT
    } catch(Exception e){
      e.printStackTrace(); // DEBUG POINT
    }
  }
}
```

This was one of my favorite ways to debug before [entering the world of Test Driven Development](https://ankushchoubey.com/tdd). Post TDD, my debugging has been even more easier and effective.
