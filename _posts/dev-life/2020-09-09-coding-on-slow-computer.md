I usually code on slow computers. These things help me keep sane.

### Disable animation and keep open apps to a minimum

### Use as much terminal/cmd as possible.
- `git`
- `npm start`

No GUI software can beat the terminal's speed.

{% include tip.html content=' To speed things up create <code>.sh/.bat</code> files so that you can run repeated commands with a click of a button' %}

### If your backend is pretty stable, run the packaged file.
In my case when I am focused on angular development only, I run the `.war` file in a separate terminal.

### Run apps separately
Instead of using the terminal from VS Code, use a separate application.

If one application crashes at least the other one is loaded.

### Optimize your IDEs

You can easily find ways to speed up your IDE. Just google it.

In my case, I have made changes to `settings.ini` files for STS (A Java IDE).
