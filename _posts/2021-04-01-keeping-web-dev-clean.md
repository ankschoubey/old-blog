## Choose a stable framework. 

I believe Angular is a more stable long term solution than React which requires too much learning. Less modification is required therefore your code will last longer. At least it seems that way right now. 

## Make very small modular pieces.
In Angular, create components even for small things like `img` or `video` tag. You’ll find that there are certain attributes you assign to every `img` tag that can be taken care of from one place

Separate app logic from business logic. You should be able to copy-paste these modules into another code base and use it without changes.

In angular, make use of everything: components, service, directives, pipes, interceptors, etc/

## Make layout components

These are common layouts you use throughout the application. Coding them in one place reduces unnecessary duplications.

## CSS

The best way to deal with CSS is to write less of it.

CSS gets messy fast. By keeping your components small. You are halfway there to a good CSS. 

Also make good use of `display: flex`. It gets most of the job done.

## HTML

The best way to keep HTML clutter-free is to not write javascript/typescript logic in it

Angular provides a `ts` file, use it for everything. Even for ngStyle or ngClass. 

This will keep your HTML very clean

Create a `get` method to keep things clean.

## Have very few utility classes.

It’s stupid to have too many utility classes spread throughout your codebase. Have only a few at a single place.

Only keep a utility class or method if it is used. Remove unnecessary code.
