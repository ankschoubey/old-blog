Break ideas:

Don't do something that distracts or takes mental effore: mindless tasks. No internet.


focus/attention
- keep distraction away for a certain time
- create a quite zone. 
- wear headphones and play music to go in the zone

If you cannot use pomodoro, you haven't planned well.

if you are not able to do pomodoro-> it means you aren't clear on what to do.
