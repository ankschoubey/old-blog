These are some things I found helpful when deciding on a new language or framework or module.

## Deciding to learn

**I pick something to learn only when the language/framework...**
- has been around for at-least a few year
- is under active development and is likely to stay
- has good community support/tools

**I find it easier to learn something by category like:**
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Currently with Java)
- **Database**: SQL (pretty much all SQL are same)
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch
- **Containerizing**: Docker
- **Hardware**: Ardruino (C++)
- **Game Development**: Yet to be decided

The benefit of learning by category is that same skills can apply to other categories.

Like: My pandas (python) skills helped me a lot during new SQL problems.

## Deciding not to learn

**I hate learning "new"** languages/framework/technology especially **when**
- it does the exact same thing that I can do now
- does not add any new benefit
- it's old/outdated
- if I'll likely never use it
- proprietary technology

**So**,
- no AngularJS after learning Angular.
- nothing less than Spring Boot when doing Java.
- Typescript > Javascript.
- PyTorch is probably enough. Don't need Tensorflow.
- SQL is enough. No need of NoSQL yet.

## Exceptions

There have always existed exceptions and cases where I just needed to learn something.
- **Old but need it**: Had to learn excel to reverse engineering and build same feature in Spring Boot
- **Learning a good framework**: Had learned Django before. After joining worked I learned Spring Boot and realized it much better.
- **Made life easy**: My application UI was crap. Easiest way was to learn CSS myself without using Bootstrap. It was easier than I expected. Thanks [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA/featured).
- **For Future**: I may learn a little Firebase just to see how fast I can develop applications in it. Hopefully transferring some of that knowledge to my daily coding.

But most exceptions occur where I either had to do it or see a benefit that is transferrable to what I do.

***

I try not to learn something just to add to resume or to list of things that just sound cool (sometimes I do).

I usually spend months deciding.

YouTube videos and written articles have been great help when deciding.
