title: Mutating Questions to deepen understanding
---

Mutation testing is a technique in software engineering where a piece of code is mutated.

We can apply same to learning.

Question Driven Writing/Learning is the best way to learn. To get deeper, we can mutate our question

So instead of a what is X?
we can ask how does X work?
Any example of X
Why X is important?
