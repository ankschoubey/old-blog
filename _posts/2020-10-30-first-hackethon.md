Always wanted to participate in one but I was afraid that my skills are not enough. 

But as I have worked as a programmer for the last two years I realize that almost everyone start with no school and figure out a solution eventually.

So my goals for joining was to learn as much as I can. I knew I could do atleast something even if not levels expected.

These are some lessons I learned

## Goal is not working software
The goal for the organizers was not a complete working software. The goal was to see how the problem can be tackled from different point of views.

## Team
Our team could have been better organized. We almost wasted 2 weeks out of 5. In the second week I tried taking up leadership, arranging meeting and talking to people. But the by 3rd week my "leadership"  declined.

The reason for decline was that I was managing another full time project.

## Support
Organizers were supportive. Plus we had access to AWS Experts.

Experimentation
Owners 
Learning
Trying something you were otherwise unable to do
