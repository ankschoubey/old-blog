I really want to be rich and not famous. There are downsides to being to famous.

But I recently realize more and more that it is better to be at least do things in public yourself.

Accountability: Taking on public accountability is a sure way to gain people's trust. it is also risky which is why most people don't do it.

being famous means people are more likely to trust you. because they kind of know you.
