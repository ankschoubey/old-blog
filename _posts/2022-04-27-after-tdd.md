title: What to test to write after functional TDD
---

More than half of what you would write a test for would get decided by TDD. These would cover basic functionality.

Essentially all tests fix the input and check the output or internal state of the applicaiton.

There are some other things that are worth paying attention to:

# Boundary Values

If something depends on a Integer or long, can that be negative?

Specially if data is coming from an external system.

# Concurrent Transactions

What would happen if 100/500/1000 requests come concurrently?

It's better to think in terms on logarithmic scale here.

I faced this problem [when a record had to be updated concurrenly](/optimistic-locking-exception-mongodb).
