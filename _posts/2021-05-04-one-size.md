# There is no one size fits all

There is no programming language that fits every case.

There is no perfect framework that is best for every case.

There is no stock/mutual fund that works for everyone.

There is no career choice which brings out the best for everyone.

There is no fixed routine/process that fits every case.

And even if you find a thing that fits, changes in environment/time will make it unfit again and you’ll have to find a new one.

Abandon Ideology. Abandon being totalitarian i’e to believe things should be done a certain way always. There is no one size fits all.
