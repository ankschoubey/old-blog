There is no programming language that fits every case. Python is not the best programming language. At least not for web development.

There is no perfect framework that is best for every case. React may be cool. But Angular is probably more stable for bigger projects.

There is no stock/mutual fund that works for everyone. Some are more stable. Some are made for those who can afford to take risks.

There is no career choice which brings out the best for everyone. Not every Software Engineer codes well (most suck). 

There is no fixed routine/process that fits every case.

And even if you find a thing that fits, changes in environment/time will make it unfit again and youâ€™ll have to find a new one.

If you think you think something is as simple as [black and white](/black_white), the probability you're wrong is high.

Abandon Ideology [^1]. Abandon being totalitarian i.e to believe things should be done a certain way always. There is no one size fits all.
