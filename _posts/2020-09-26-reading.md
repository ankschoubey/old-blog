Reading is the nourishment that lets you do think in interesting ways. [^1]

In some sense, you are downloading dense information into your brain fast.

And it is fun! More fun than many TV shows after a certain point.

Books are of higher quality because they go through a lot of "processes". Other mediums do not.
Draft->Editors->Reviews->Publisher.

## Habit
Keeping distractions away while reading helps.

To start, read anything. Even a page better than no page.

Reading slowly is okay. You may finish the book in 3 months. Not a big deal.

## New words

If you don't know a word in the book. Learn it right there and there. If you don't you are just approximating what the author says.

If you are going to read a series of ðŸ“š then learn each new word. The same word will be used later.

## Selecting books to read
Reading from different categories is an easy way to broaden your perspective.

Always be reading at least 2 books, fiction, and non-fiction.
- Non-fiction: Make your more informed and put things into action.
- Fiction: Makes you less boring and counteracts the overthinking created by non-fiction.

Don't buy non-fiction books that have just been released. Let the reviews come in.

If the right book is selected, it is worth paying the price.

## Reasoning

Don't agree with everything you read. Authors are humans too. [^3]

Put yourself in the shoes of the author and try to reason through his conclusions.

You want to internalize the author's thinking so that you can see the problem from his point of view. [^1]

Reading books which provide a counter-argument to your thought or to a book you have read is also interesting.

## Speed Reading
If you are speed reading, it is probably not worth reading. [^1]

Reading speed increases naturally as you get into a habit of reading regularly.
