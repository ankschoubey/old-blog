## Keep CSS and HTML to a minimum

- CSS and HTML are every dependent. Remove unnecessary tags and CSS classes.
- Lesser the CSS and HTML, easier it is to modify.

## Use flex and grid for adjusting positions

- These are much more dynamic than using position absolute.

## Don't use absolute lengths, use relative lengths

- absolute lengths include cm, px, etc. relative lengths include em, cm, rem etc.
- if a width or height need to be a certain character length use "ch". This cannot be used for font-size
- "vh" and "vw" can also be used but they are not perfect. instead use em or rem. rem is more preferred.

## Use CSS variables

- CSS variables allow for easily changing CSS on the fly.

## For DevExpress, modify dx-widget property

- .dx-widget class is applied to all DevExpress component so modifying it for changing something like font-size will effect every dx component.
- For responsiveness, rely on CSS not JS.
- Unless absolutely needed, JS should not be used to re-enforce responsiveness.

## Media Queries

- Assuming you are used most of the tips above, your CSS should be fairly small.
- Now you can use media queries for hiding elements.
- Before using media queries decide on the size of displays you want to support. This will make sure media query parameters is same across application.
