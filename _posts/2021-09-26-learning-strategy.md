title: Learning Strategies
---

These are some strategies I use to learn any new thing including programming languages.

These are probably very influenced by Tim Ferriss's 4 Hour Chef which I had read around 2016.

## Material beats Method [^1]

Usually, it's not fault of the student, it's fault of the teacher.

How a teacher teaches determines a lot.

I don't like live teachings. It sometimes gets to fast sometimes too slow. I prefer learning on my own.

I pick resources that are:

1. Step by step
2. Have a clear road to some kind of implementation
3. As real world as possible.

For example:

For Music:

- I tried learning Piano by reading book but it was no boring and vage. So I purchased SimplyPiano.
- Similarly for guitar I got SimplyGuitar.

For Programming Topics,

- I prefer platform allow trying out code online without any local installation.
  - Codecademy is a good one. I used it for many things.
  - Recently I started learning

## Role of Books

I don't use books for learning everything.

But certain concepts are such that they require an entire book.

I don't go out to but book instantly. I wait a few days to see if I really need to.

Sometimes YouTube videos are enough to cure curiosity or find the answer.

Books are great for deep topics have a lot of details in it.

## Learn in chunks

I cannot learn something at one. If I try to do it I will have to recollection of the concepts. So I prefer doing a little every day or regularly.

This also forces me to recall what I had previously learned.

So for,

- Piano and Guitar: 10 Min a Day
- Technical Topics: Max 2 Pomodoros (25 min timers twice with 5-10 min break in middle)
- Books: 10-20 minutes max

## Clear Doubts along the way

If you are stuck, search for the solution.

Usually learning from different sources helps.

## Have Cheat Sheets

Cheat sheets allow recalling what you have learned instantly!

Often googling cheatsheets is sufficient.

## Put into Practice Fast

Deployable.

Record yourself.

Talk to other people

## Using flash cards

Flashcards can be helpful addition to remembering more. In many things, there is a need to remember more.

Here are some things to keep in mind when using flashcards.

1. Use 80/20 rule and focus on the few concepts worth memorizing. You want number of cards to be at a minimum. 
2. Assume each card is going to take 10 seconds per revision. Multiple by number of cards you create to get how much time you'll remember.
2. Know all the concepts first and organize them. Maybe use a highlighter, pen to mark them.
2. If a flashcard is too big to remember, then break it down.
5. Write in memorable way, good questions and for answers use diagrams, accronyms or some patterns.
6. Digital Flashcards have advantage that you can modify. But maybe having less number of flashcard overall is better. 

You may expect 1-2 hours of flashcard study a week. If it's a competitive exam, then per day.

Flashcards are one part. Often discussion with others is a better way to internalize.
