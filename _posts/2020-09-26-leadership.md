I've been watching Simon Sinek videos lately.

Leadership can be thought of in multipe ways.

## The un-cool
- He/She is a "leader" because of their position in an organization
- Usually people who have 0 to negative skills but aged so they can't be working at the bottom
- Pain to ideas/people around them.

## The cool one
- A person who make the choice to be a leader regardless of their position in the organization.
- He/She sees a problem and
  - proposes a solution
  - takes on responsibilities
  - delivers on them
  - disagrees to a process/method/idea when it is needed
- If someone is stuck, he/she helps them and doesn't just leave them i.e he/she is a good team member.
- Treats everyone the same regardless of their title.
