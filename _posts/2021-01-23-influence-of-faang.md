A companies valuations can be seen as hour influencial the company is.

As of Jan 2021, FAANG companies are most influencial companies with a very high market cap.

FAANG stands for 
Facebook
Apple
Amazon
Netflix
Google

These companies are hailed by software engineers and the competition to get is tough.

For the below details I am excluding Netflix as it not as big as the other 4.

Here is how much they influence other aspects of the world including us:

Attention

Data

Money and Small Businesses
- Out of every dollar a VC invests into a startup, 40 cents goes to Facebook, Amazon and Google. [^1]

Power
- Amazon Web Services, the most profitable of Amazon's companies, control nearly half of Global Cloud Infrastructure.
- A few years ago, a single code bug caused a lot of we known websites to crash. Websites like Netflix, Tinder, etc.
