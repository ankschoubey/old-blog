Responsibility

Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities voluntarily and facing your fears, you'll avoid being nihilistic. 

So, pick the heaviest weight you can take and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then at least you can know, "Dumb as I am, I can at least push a thing from point A to point B" [^1]

Taking on responsibility voluntarily/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you'll have your life sorted.

Extreme Ownership:

Nothing outside your own power is effecting your life.

Your life. You choose.

Do

Don't just think DOn't just talk or dream. None of that matter. The only thing that matters is do. [^1]

There is nothing more important than taking care of yourself like someone you can for.

Because if you don't you become burden on others


My physical health
My mental health
My family's physical health
My family mental health
Friends
Work
Money: buys you freedom
Time outside of work


Take on more responsibility and everyone/universe will reward you more.

When people come to you with respo. You should accept it.

With great power comes create respo.

----

it is good for you to become a person you can admire.

To push beyond what's typical


Do it for yourself.

Respo and Courage:

Imagine who you would be if you didn't stop.

You have to move forward.
Waiting makes you shrink.
If you don't know what to do. Pick something and walk towards it. You're not where you were. 

No one is comming to save you.

God make you a man and gave you enough ability to save yourself.

I am not what happened to me. I am what I choose to become.

You cannot help everyone. Focus on yourself first.

You cannot give up on yourself for anyone else. You have your goals and priorities.
