title: Why memorizing is still relevant?
---

There is a cognitive bias called the Google Effect.

This means that if we know where to find the information, we won’t try to remember it. Instead we’ll roughly know the location of where to find it.

This might seem nice at first. But here are some problems:

To make any sense of the world/a topic: we need to keep our mind on it long enough to create meaningful connections.

This won’t happen when we just know the reference and have to go read things over.

In real world, the problems we face are usually of a repetitive nature this is because we haven’t taken time forming the habits/strategies to cope with that. The more we can remember,

We need to make decisions. To make decisions fast and efficiently, we need to know, remember and recall hard facts on the fly.

By remembering we also save a lot of time in finding, re-reading and coming to the same conclusions again.

All these make it important to memorize/remember things better.
