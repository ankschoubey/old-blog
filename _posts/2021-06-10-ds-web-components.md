My dear younger self, 

You believed DevOps is bs and a buzzword. It kind of is. But it is highly valuable and important too.

Though you won’t always build something awesome from scratch and instead configure an existing tool to do the job, without DevOps you won’t be free to code.

You’ll spend all your time maintaining and deploying your code manually.

In this post, I’ll try to convince you why upper management likes DevOps so much.

I'm making a web component library using React to make it easier to interface Machine Learning style things.
