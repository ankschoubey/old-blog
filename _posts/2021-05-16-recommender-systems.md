Recommender systems are easiest and probably most lucritive ML Application.

The whole of social media, content sites and E-Commerce Companies are built around it.

The goal is said to be to provide right information at the right time and avoiding information overload. The statement seems ideal and a recommender system can be made to work such a way.

Most often for consumer facing products, the real reason is the opposite. Keep people hooked to using the product for longer.
