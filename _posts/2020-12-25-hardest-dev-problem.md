Setting up a local development environment is one of the, if not the most discouraging part of software development. Coding is easier.

Typically it takes me over a day of effort just putting all tools together ready to be used.

Also typically software updates sometimes break a setup and lead to more changed to be done.

Here is a way this effort can be minimized.

## Use Docker to create your Dev Environment

In case you don't know about docker, it's is like a virtual machine which is much faster than a typical virtual machine.

Since it is fast enough, you can replicate all your non-gui setup very easily on it.

## VS Code

I have been using Spring Tool Suit and VS Code together. The problem is STS is very slow.

VS Code not only has all the main tools I need it has better extension support.

I have switch to VS Code completely

## VS Code Docker Remote Extension


Specially if you are using multiple 3rd party things



One can solve this problem by using docker
