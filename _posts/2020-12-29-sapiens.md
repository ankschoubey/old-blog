I am trying to write the summary of this book as a way to better remember what I understood. 

The book took around 2 months to complete. I am a slow reader.

The book is a brief history and it transitions fast and beautifully from one topic to another.

It also presents arguments and counter arguments in a way that tries to explain the whole thing from maximum points of view. This kind of writing and thinking is something I aspire to.

Here are the things I learned from the 4 sections.

Cognitive Revolutions.

We had a lot of cousin humans. Once upon a time, Around 6 species of humans roamed earth at the once.

1. We are not special. 3 billion year the universe was born. It will stay for billions. We are not even the human speci that has survived the longest (as of yet).
2. There are countless species. We are just speci that got luckly thanks to our intellect and imagined realities.
3. History is random. There are cause and effect to certain events but there is no reason why history could not have turned in some other way.
4. Religion is a recent thing. about 10,000 years ago.
7. The way we interact and work together with stranger and form groups larger than 150 is by imaging things.
5. Societal contructs like nation, company, ethics, etc are imagined realities shared by billions. It's so strong that we act according to them in real world.
6. There is no justice in history. Even human right is a imagined contructs. There is nothing in biology that suggest it to be a truth. These contructs do help keep people sane.
6. Huntergathers were healthier than us but they did not live for that long.
7. There is no going back once Agriculture Revolution started. Why would someone want to go back to hunting.
8. We are Thanos for other species. Our speci has captured and killed and effected almost all animals on earth.
9. We don't look animals with the same view as we look at other humans. We abolished slavery 


Capitalizm. 
- Science is largely a product of Capitalizm and politics. 
- Capitalizm is
- Capitalist if not checked can do anything for money. Slave trading companies were listed in London Stock Exchange. This seems kind of similar to current privacy breaching companies or how we farm animals.
- The stock investor would not care what happens in the company. he is just interacted in making a return.
- Government and legal checks are necessary to keep Capitalists in check.

Scientific revolution started as a result of europeans accepting that they are ignorant and they don't know many things.
The  reason Scientific revolution took place in europe instead of India or China (even if Asia controlled 80% of world GDP) is because of social constructs. Asias did not accepted their ignorance and their did not venture out to find answers to things they did not know.


Money crossed lines which religion could not. Everybody loves money.

The 3 things that brought human kind togher are; Empired, Religion, Money.

There have been many types of money and does not include just coin.

Maths allowed us to predit the future.

We are all influenced by europeans culture. No country has original culture. It's a mix.

Time and timetable tracking is recent. Though it is very efficient.

Western liberals mix their view with buddist view. Buddist view is not that the happiness in individual and it must be protected. The main part is the internal states are fleeting and they change every moment. There is no point in chasing after it.

Banks and the whole financial system are built on credit. They provide more money than they actually have hoping for a future return. This is a large contributer to human progress.

individual needs are now satisfied by state and organizations instead of family and comunity.
- If you want money, you can take loan.
- if you want education you go to school.
- if you are unmeployeed there are un-employment schemes.
- if you are old, there are retirement schemes.

New material discovered increase progress rapidly.

Humans have transended genetic boundaries.
- We learn faster and adapt quicker. Unlike other animals whose genes dictate what they do.
- We have created medicines and technologies that far exceed and extend our natural limitations.

A band of good communation sapiens of 500 could beat Neandethals with pack of 5 times more.

Gossip is natural to us. Gossip conveys important information like who to avoid, what to do, what not to do, etc which helps us be safe.

Humans have been safer than ever. And we seem to be moving towards more peace.

Compared to history, the decolonization of colonies have been relatively peaceful. Everyone seem to be tired of war.

Biology is always changing. It is never constant or fixed. If you go by this line of thinking, more than human 2 gender are possible and biology won't have any problem with it.
