As I get older I realize one thing that most things you want you can just ask for it.

Do you want an opportunity? Ask the person forward.

Do you want to get a refund? Or have a customer complain then said don’t hide.

Everyone is there to help. But no Will know when to help if you don’t say that you need it.

Companies want to keep their customers happy. Most companies do. 

Similarly even people want other people to grow and help yhem.

This gives them an opportunity to ask you for help when they need it.
