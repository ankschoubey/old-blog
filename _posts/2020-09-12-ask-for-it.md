As I get older I realize one thing that most things you want you can just ask for it.

#### **Do you want an opportunity?**
Ask the person in charge.

#### **Do you want to get a refund or have a customer complain?**
Say it. Don’t hide.

#### **Want a bit of specific advice from someone celebrity figure you admire?**
Text/Tweet at them (Keep it short at quick)

#### Everyone is there to help.

But no will know when to help if you don’t say that you need it.

Companies want to keep their customers happy.
Similarly, even people want other people to grow and help them.

This also allows them to ask you for help when they need it. [^1]
