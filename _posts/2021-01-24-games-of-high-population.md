I have started noticing trends after reading Sapiens.

## On Paper Companies

I am realized a weird Ponzi Scheme recently. One that is totally legit. That is valuation of companies.

Many companies don't actually make profit. And if we look at their market valuations, it will be huge.

Like whatsapp, it was a free product for the most part but it's valuation was 16 billion when it was sold.

The likely reason for their customer base was because they offered free product.

Changing such a model would cause people to flee.

It's similar to WeWork a startup that got a lot of funding but got bankrupt. It never had a good business model.

## Innovating is hard.

The effect of globalization, internet and software have been such that distribution has become cheap and fast.

It has probably never been easier to start a company and reach millions of people.

In such a scenario, finding new profitable business ideas are hard. 

People need work. They need busineeses to provide for their family.

If we assume really profitable top teir business they must be a 50% of the market.

So atleast these facade companies provide people salaries.

## It is hard to be profitable.

Many facade companies do bring in innovation. Since billions of dollars are put into the facade company.

Many times ever founders and VCs do not know if the company is facade.
