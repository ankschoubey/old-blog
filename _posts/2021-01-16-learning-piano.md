Piano is the most important thing I have learned in a long time. I am still learning and far from being good.

In some sense, it is just a speaker which is manual and more satisfying.

Here are some thinking I learned while playing Piano:

- Little things add up.
- Break the problem into chunks.
- Progress is not linear. Or atleast it does not seem linear

## Material Beats Method

I had a keyboard since childhood but I was never able to learn it. Random tutorials did not seem to help. Purchasing SimplyPiano was a good thing.

## Upfront work

Many try taking shortcut of avoiding sheet music and go directly to the song. 

## Little things add up.

I realized that a lot of times I was skipping parts of the practice. Skipping chords, going through the lessons too fast, Not practising enough before the next lesson. Not learning left hand properly.

Though all of these things were small in the beginning they started to slow me down.

## CHunking

If I was having trouble with a specific piece, I can isolate the piece and practice it.

If while playing I found my left hand to be not playing properly, I can practice left hand in isolation.

In the end all the little things add up.

## Playing everyday

Initially I was playing about 3 times a week for 15 minutes each. ROI of early progress was huge.

Later practising everyday for 15 minutes became a hobbie. Some days by hand would pain.

## Calm
Being calm is one of the most importatn things piano taught me. If I am not calm it will be hard for me to concentrate and I will not only make mistakes but I will not know why I am sucking at tis piece.

## Increased Concentration

Playing piano allowed me to increase my concentration time beyond the intensity I was used to. Often time my brain would be on full throttle but my hand would start paining and I would have to stop.

## Being getle

Banging your fingers on the piano is a sure way to suffer. I made this mistake a lot earlier.

Initially my hands were stiff. Over the months they have got lighter. 

## Joy of playing thanks to sheet music

I am not sure how many others learned piano. Learning sheet music seems to be a boon. I did not memorize most of my songs until Fur-elise and I could play almost all Begineer level songs from SimplyPiano directly from the sheet music.

## Searching for Information 

Almost always after playing for a while I'll have questions regarding Piano. I would search on YouTube and find lessons from YouTUbe teacher.

I would search things like How do i play with my left hand better. Hand coordingation, D Position, Proper Posture, etc. 

This helped a lot as SimplyPiano did not include a lot of details.

## Gearing up

Initially I kept the piano on a pillow. But a YouTube video suggested getting a proper stand so I got it.

Later I got sustain pedal while practicing fur-elise

## Humility

Piano tought be to be patient and humble. Often watching kids on YouTube play better than me makes me cry.

Often if I suck as a new lesson, if I work on it for 15 days, i'll get it.

## Rabbit Hole

Learning Piano is a rabbit hole. I have seen YouTuber learning after 10-12 year. I don't wish to be only associated with a piano. So after SimplyPiano. I'll stop. I'll try to focus on other things.

I'll probably take up something else. I hope to find something as step by step as SimplyPiano
