The piano is the most important thing I have learned in a long time. I am still learning and far from being good.

In some sense, it is just a speaker which is manual and more satisfying.

Here is some thinking I learned while playing the Piano:

- Little things add up.
- Break the problem into chunks.
- Progress is not linear. Or at least it does not seem linear

## Material Beats Method

I had a keyboard since childhood though I never learned it. Random tutorials did not seem to help. 

What changed was purchasing SimplyPiano and free time (lockdown).

## Upfront work

Many try taking the shortcut of avoiding sheet music and go directly to the song. It is much easier to get started with Sheet Music.

Learning sheet music seems to be a boon. I did not memorize most of my songs until Fur-Elise. I can play almost all Begineer level songs from SimplyPiano directly from the sheet music.

## Part of A Whole

I realized that a lot of times I was skipping parts of the practice. Skipping chords, going through the lessons too fast, Not practising enough before the next lesson. Not learning left hand properly.

Though all of these things were small in the beginning they started to slow me down.

## Isolation

A specific section of pieces can be practised in isolation.

## Playing regularly

Initially, I was playing about thrice a week for 15 minutes each. ROI of early progress high.

Later practising every day for 15 minutes became a hobby. 

## Concentration and Being Calm

Sometimes playing Piano requires concentration like reading a good book. Often time my brain would be on full throttle flow mode.

## Calm

Not being calm makes it hard to concentrate. 
If I am not calm it will be hard for me to concentrate and I will not only make mistakes but I will not know why I am sucking at this piece.

## Being gentle
Banging your fingers on the piano is a sure way to suffer. I made this mistake a lot earlier.

Initially, my hands were stiff. Over the months they have got lighter. 

## Joy of playing sheet music

I am not sure how many others learned Piano. 

## Searching for Information 

Almost always after playing for a while, I'll have questions. I would search and find answers on YouTube. The reason was that SimplyPiano did not include a lot of details.

These are some things I had trouble with where YouTube helped:
Playing with a left hand
Hand Coordination
D Position
Proper Posture
Hand Injury

## Gearing up

Initially, I kept my keyboard over a pillow. A YouTube video suggested getting a proper stand so I got one.

The stand instantly improved my playing by 30%.

Later I got sustain pedal while practising fur-elise

## Humility

Piano taught me to be patient and humble. Often watching kids on YouTube play better than me makes me cry.

Often if I suck as a new lesson, I'll get it after 15 days.

## Rabbit Hole

Learning Piano is a rabbit hole. I have seen YouTuber learning after 10-12 year. I don't wish to be only associated with a piano. So after SimplyPiano. I'll stop. I'll try to focus on other things.

I'll probably take up something else. I hope to find something as step by step as SimplyPiano.
