title: Why do I write?

Writing clarifies my thought more than anything. It converts chaos into an order of some kind.

The better I write and explain, the better I get at solving interpersonal problems.

Writing protects me against the Dunning-Krugger effect. The effect is where one has learned a bunch of things but isn’t aware that he knows.

This is because writing builds up documentation of progress. It’s something that I can look back on and derive insights and meaning.

Writing serves as a public view of my knowledge and ideas.

It serves as a great self-promotion on a resume and during job interviews.
