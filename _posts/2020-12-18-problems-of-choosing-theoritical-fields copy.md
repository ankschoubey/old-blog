there are many field where the reward of discovering a new things are a long time before there is implementation.

things like pure maths, theoritical physics, etc.

Europeans gained significant advantage over other civilazation during the colonial area because of their willingness to accept they don't know things and to find the ways to understand the world better. [^1]

The question of scientific progress was as important as anything polical.

Though today we live in a era were a lot of scientific progress is made. The increase is because a large number of people are working on the problem even if the problems they are trying to solve are trivial (like social media).

The amount of effort required to research in pre-colonial and colonial era was far greater. This should increase the the productivity and it does in some sense. But it also reduces the effort on human part and therefore the end result is same.

## Research

Research get a entitement. People think it is hard.

It's not. You just have to work at something. And if you work on it you may discover things that you don't even know to be true.

The reason research get's a bad entitelemnt of because of ready made solutions and the things that are already been discovered/made.

We miss the point that all the polished discoveries we see today had humble beginings. 

I would argue that if the discovered you made or a solution you made even is it already exist and you didn't know about is is still an act of research. Though not super fruitful.

## Ready made solutions

Counter Argument: Globalisation

Globalisation has allowed us to take fruits of someone elses research.

As of 2020, China and USA dominate technology. We Indians (and many from other countries) are more of a witness to this domination.

There are also different issues to solve. The social issues in India and different than those in developed nations. And therefore globalisation has a faster positive impact compared to research activities.
