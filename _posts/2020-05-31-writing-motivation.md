This is collections of posts/ideas I have come across over the years.

## Writing is thinking

- Writing is learning how to think. Writing is a reflection of your thoughts.

## Medium

- The best thing about writing on a computer is that you can edit things later which is the same as editing your thoughts
- The best things about writing by hand is no distraction. no pressure. clean slate. clear thinking.
- Combine both

## To write better, you don't have to become a "writer"

- Grammar is very small part of writing. The most important thing is having something useful to say.

- The way to have something interesting to say is to go experience the world.

- Narate from our own experience. This keeps things unique and interesting.

- Improve your writing in every opportunity you get

- Prefer using active voice instead of passive to keep your writing more exciting.

## Use less words

- If it can be said in a blogpost, don't write a book. If it can be said in a tweet, don't write a blog post.

- One big idea per post

- Delete sentences. Remove all the useless words. 

- Forget attributions. It makes you slow. Plus you want it to be your own thoughts. So make those thoughts your own. Don't care about attributions. 

## Writing helps you to 

- Form your thoughts better
  
- Document and share your progress
