This is collections of posts/ideas I have come across over the years.

## Writing is thinking

- Writing is learning how to think. Writing is a reflection of your thoughts.

## To write better, you don't have to become a "writer"

- Grammar is very small part of writing. The most important thing is having something useful to say.

- The way to have something interesting to say is to go experience the world.

- Improve your writing in every opportunity you get

## Use less words

- If it can be said in a blogpost, don't write a book. If it can be said in a tweet, don't write a blog post.

- One big idea per post

- Don't quote make it yours and say it yourself.

## Writing helps you to 

- Form your thoughts better
- Document and share your progress
