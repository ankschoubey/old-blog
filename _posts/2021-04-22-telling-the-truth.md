## Why?

By telling the truth, you won't have to remember much. You won't have to remember who you lied to and what. And so you can express yourself without second guessing.

If you always tell the truth, you won't lie to yourself. Wishful thinking is a trap which will have an easier time avoiding if you always tell the truth.

Truth leads to clarity. Truth will set you free. If you are not free, see if you are speaking the truth or don't know it completely.

Telling the truth is adventurous.

### Foundation

Telling the truth is easier when you believe certain assumptions:

1. By telling the truth, the best possible scenario that can happen will happen.
2. While speaking the truth even if you are afraid to think you are alone know that others exists. they are just as afraid as you.

If you are overwhelmed, see if you are telling the truth. 

## Telling the truth unhides the fog. Truth always shines.

Not telling the truth is bad for self esteem.

## Why you should speak up

At meetings, everybody does not understand. By speaking up and asking questions, giving suggestion everyone benifits.

By speaking up, likeminded people will come to you.

By speaking up, you increase trust.

By speaking up, you never have the regret of being silent.

By speaking up, if someday you are on a wrong track others will speak up and tell you.

## Framing

Framing is something we use all the time.

Every information has to be compressed in some way else it will take forever to speak. 

Therefore, we have to make sure we be as precise as possible without taking forever to convey.

## How to speak up and tell the truth?

### Tell the truth or atleast not lie.

Philosophy is not mathematics. There are no hard rules let's assume their is.

You have have to hide facts from let's say kids, that is okay. But don't lie.

### Tell it fast and Tell it fully
Be precise in your speech.

If you are good at articulations, you should articulate for someone else specially with the person you are having the argument. The goal is to get to the truth and understanding, and not to win.

### Do not do things that you hate
### Act so that you can tell the truth about how you act

Live by the truth. Listen to your consons.

### Express your intend properly.

Be polite. Don't try to humilate. 

By framing make sure your express the intend of solving the problem else your speaking truth will backfire.

# Tell the truth. See the truth. Listen to the truth. Test the truth.

Speak out the truth. See the truth. ....

# Looking at Truth

Reduce ego to see and accept what's true

Don't just look at works. Look at actions and patterns overtime. With yourself and in others. Action is the only truth in yourself and in others. You can ask questions to yoruself and others to gain clarity or tell them what you are thinking based on their actions.

Without thinnking anything/adding biases. Try to think like another person wood.

Thinking in questions: TDD

Simplest explaination?

First Principles Thinking

Assuming you are wrong : quantify with probability


To be as truthful as possible, always think beforre saying.
Deliver truth to yourself first fully. And form it well
- If you are talking about events think and recall the event and recall what happened then exactly

You are what you do not what you say you are going to do.

It's not like you can hide the truth or your intentions. So don't even try. your intent always shows
therefore 

Peace/Truth: Be authentic 100%

The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.

What's your truth?

Also courage: What do you do when no one is watching? When only you watch? 


To be honest, speak without identity.

Truth and courage: A man is worth how much truth he can handle/tolerate. 

You need to be mentally tough enough to listen to the truth without getting emotional. Toughness is measured by how much you can take, not by how aggressive you can be.


Share uncerstaininty. (Phrases like: Mixed feeling are appropriate )
Share your interntions

All extremely good things happen in truth. So your identity should not matter.

Make sure each time you speak your words have wright. Sometimes silence have higher weight.

Team: be a very good explainer.


Live in reality
Movies/TV Shows/Anime/Most works of friction aren't real.

Learn to talk slowly. Rushing increases probability of not being truthful.

Activities that increase probability of being truthful: truth-booster, truth-rival
