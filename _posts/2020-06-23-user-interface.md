User Interfaces are such fascinating things. I had my interest peaked after I had to work on responsive CSS (thanks 🔥 [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA/videos))

## **AUC**: The area under the curve

A bad UI means a product is essentially useless or trying to look useless.

A good UI means a product is at least trying to look useful.

A new feature release is like solving a big problem for a small number of users 📈.

An improvement to UI (especially on OS level) means solving a small problem for a vast number of users 📊.

The area under the curve remains the same [^1] that is why it is so useful.

## Physical World

This is not specific to UI, this is general to any design including once in the physical world.

Something I had a real wonder at was the lights at the back of vehicles. They are just so simple yet I could not imagine any better alternative.
 - left-right lights
 - red lights for brake

## Interfaces

It is quite wonderful to know UI is a field that has not matured. It is something that keeps improving and we have new things being added.

Keyboard ⌨️ → Mouse 🖱 → Touch → Gestures → body motion → Speech → Neuralink 😍

## Trends

Some design trends are definitely weird.

Like Neuromorphism, I don't know why would someone make UI harder to use and increase their workload at the same time.

Dear Apple, 🥺 why would you do this to Mac OS Big Sur?

But at the same time, this was the same reaction everyone had when Flat Design was introduced and in a few years, people love it.

Same with Cyber Truck 😍 and PS5 design.

## Craftmanship

I happen to get an eye for design after getting my first apple product and watching their promotion videos. I was hooked. Jony Ive [^2] and Steve Jobs paid such a high concentration to detail that it still is reflected in most Apple physical product designs.

The same is true when Mr. Musk decided not to put headlight buttons for Teslas [^4]. If it's dark, it should just come on.

There is so much craftsmanship that goes into a high-quality product. It is so much fun knowing what goes behind building a great product.

Their way of thinking is essentially making technology invisible.

It feels just like Magic [^3]! It just works!
