The answers by themselves are not that important.

The process for finding the answer is more important so that people can work in parallel.

Over-dependence is a  bottleneck. Always providing ready-made solutions seems to turn people weak and dependent.

And it is your responsibility [^1] to make them capable of themselves finding the answers and making informed decisions.
