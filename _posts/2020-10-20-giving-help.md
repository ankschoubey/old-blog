The answers by themselves are not that important.

The process for finding the answer is more important so that they can replicate the process later.

Over-dependence is a  bottleneck. Always providing ready-made solutions seems to turn people weak and dependent.

And it is your responsibility [^1] to make them capable of themselves finding the answers and making informed decisions.

So, everyone is free to work on problems that truly matter to them. The once that only they can solve. Allowing people to work in parallel.

Great companies are structured such that the star entrepreneur/performer can leave the company at any moment. The company will still run just fine.
