I understand that there are many different types of companies and not all companies are tech companies.

While a company is first being build there is a shortcut which many companies takes.

Which is they copy features from other companies.

It helps companies to:
- Avoid R&D of Product
- Avoid Market Research
- They already know who to sell too.
- They already know the mistakes to avoid.

This can be because the copy they are copying from are from another geographic location or another market like they serve only premium customers.

I don't think it is as bad to copy once or twice. Sometimes customers demand a product to be a certain way. The company has to put down it's ego and listen to it's customer.

But I do hate companies which survive only on copying features and do not ever innovate or put their own thoughts into the product.

Innovative companies set trends. If you are always copying them, you don't have any advantage. They do.

Customer start to see the company as clone of original.

Company which innovates and others have to catch up
- Apple
- Tesla
- Uber
- AirBnB
- Google
- Snapchat

Companies which has to catch up some times
- Apple increasing size of their phones.

Copyed because of geographic advantage
- Ride sharing services after

Company which copies everything
- Facebook and it's products
- Reliance Jio
- Xiomi and other smartphone markers
