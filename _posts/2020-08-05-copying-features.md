While building a product there is a shortcut which many companies take which is they copy features from others.

### It helps companies to
- Avoid Market Research
  - They already know who to sell too.
- Avoid R&D of Product
  - They already know the mistakes to avoid.

### This can be because the product they are copying from
- is from another geographic location
- or another market like they serve only premium customers
- or the company is so big that they don't care if they are copying someone else. Money is all that matters.

### Copying sometimes is okay

I don't think it is as bad to copy once or twice. Sometimes customers demand a product to be a certain way. The company has to put down its ego and listen to its customer.

But I do hate companies that survive only on copying features and do not ever innovate or put their thoughts into the product.

**Innovative companies set trends**. *If you are always copying them, you don't have an advantage. They do.*

Customers start to see the company as a clone of the original.
