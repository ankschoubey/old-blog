title: Fixing Tools - IDE, Code Editors, Etc.
---

It takes too many interations and years to learn and master a new tools. Switching between IDE and Code Editors have very low impact if all of them essentially do the same thing.

A good IDE should provide:
1. Lots of feature to reduce coding effort
2. Plugin Support
3. Frequent Updates

I believe 2 IDE specially excel at these:

1. IntelliJ
2. VS Code

I find IntelliJ to be better at out of the box features specially refactoring. Using IntelliJ opens up for easy migration between all JetBrains tools.

VS Code has better and more plugin.
