title: Fixing Tools - IDE, Code Editors, Etc.
---

Mastering an IDE means knowing and using features, shortcuts, plugins, etc. 

It takes too many interations and years to learn and master a new tools. As you know IDE in detail, your productivity level increases tremendously.

Switching between IDE and Code Editors have very low impact if all of them essentially do the same thing.

This is similar to [my approach for deciding to learn a programming topic](/new_tech).

A good IDE should provide:
1. Lots of feature to reduce coding effort
2. Plugin Support
3. Frequent Updates

I believe 2 IDE specially excel at these:

1. IntelliJ
2. VS Code

I find IntelliJ to be better at out of the box features specially refactoring. Using IntelliJ opens up for easy migration between all JetBrains tools.

Eclipse is probably the worst ever.

VS Code has better and more plugin.
