Information is clutter. Finding applicable information is power.

The more applicable information you can find, the more you can apply them and make better decisions.

## Why information should be applied?
- Information if not applied is meaningless unless it is your profession to find and document new information.
- By appling information faster, you will solve your problems faster or atleast move towards solving your problems faster.
- The information that is not learned will be forgotten.

## Finding applicable information

There are many ways to find applicable information, these are a few that come to mind.

### Planning

## Asking Questions

Knowing People who can answer

Searching and Googling

Being multidisciplinary.

## Mental Models and Heuristics.

## Segregation of Duties / Friends who what the best for you.

Knowledge vs Thinking

You need time to think

Having knowledge is not enough. You need time to think. Absorb the information and make it your own.
