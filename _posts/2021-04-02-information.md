Finding Applicable Information

I don't know how to write this and how to present. I'll also change the blogpost title later.

Why information should be applied?
- Information if not applied is meaningless unless it is your profession to find and document new information.

By appling information faster, you will solve your problems faster or atleast move towards solving your problems faster.

Planning.

Asking Questions.

Knowing People who can answer.

Searching and Googling

Reading Books

I have yet to understand the structure of many types of books so I haven't practices this yet: skip pages liberay. Read only chapters that are applicable then close the book and live your life.

Being multidisciplinary.

Mental Models and Heuristics.

Segregation of Duties / Friends who what the best for you.

Thinking

Knowledge vs Thinking
