## Problems
Online communication of any kind causes a lot of miss understandings.

The reason is that you cannot know the mood of the person or what the situation is due to not being in physical proximity.

These things are compounded by:
- Typos
- Words that seem sarcastic or taunts.
- Grammar
- Mood/Situation of a person when he/she is reading the text
- His/her prior knowledge regarding the topic being discusses

Because of these, the intent of the message is prone to be taken completely differently.

Not to mention that texting is a slow process.

## Tips

### Try to pick a better medium
In-person > Video > Voice > Snaps > Text
`
### Avoid long text message threads if possible.

Text is also totally useless for explaining your feeling. So donâ€™t. Itâ€™s not the personâ€™s fault. It's just the medium.

140 characters seem like a nice rule to follow. This keeps things light.

## Use the right emojis ðŸ™ƒ
They lighten things up even more.

### Expect delay
No one is free 100% of the time.
