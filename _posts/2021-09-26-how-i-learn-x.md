title: Learning Strategies
---

These are some strategies I use to learn any new thing including programming languages.

These are probably very influenced by Tim Ferriss's 4 Hour Chef which I had read around 2016.

## Material beats Method [^1]

Usually, it's not fault of the student, it's fault of the teacher.

How a teacher teaches determines a lot.

I don't like live teachings. It sometimes gets to fast sometimes too slow. I prefer learning on my own.

I pick resources that are:

1. Step by step
2. Have a clear road to some kind of implementation
3. As real world as possible.

For example:

For Music:

- I tried learning Piano by reading book but it was no boring and vage. So I purchased SimplyPiano.
- Similarly for guitar I got SimplyGuitar.

For Programming Topics,

- I prefer platform allow trying out code online without any local installation.
  - Codecademy is a good one. I used it for many things.
  - Recently I started learning

## Role of Books

I don't use books for learning everything.

But certain concepts are such that they require an entire book.

I don't go out to but book instantly. I wait a few days to see if I really need to.

Sometimes YouTube videos are enough to cure curiosity or find the answer.

Books are great for deep topics have a lot of details in it.

## Learn in chunks

I cannot learn something at one. If I try to do it I will have to recollection of the concepts. So I prefer doing a little every day or regularly.

This also forces me to recall what I had previously learned.

So for,

- Piano and Guitar: 10 Min a Day
- Technical Topics: Max 2 Pomodoros (25 min timers twice with 5-10 min break in middle)
- Books: 10-20 minutes max

## Clear Doubts along the way

If you are stuck, search for the solution.

Usually learning from different sources helps.

## Have Cheat Sheets

Cheat sheets allow recalling what you have learned instantly!

Often googling cheatsheets is sufficient.

## Put into Practice Fast

Deployable.

Record yourself.
