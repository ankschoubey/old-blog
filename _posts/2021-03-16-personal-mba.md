I had been thinking and writing a lot of article but the amount of time it was taking me was huge.

So, this book eliminates 80% of my future blog posts.

I realized that it would be better that starts with general ideas which I could later look deeply into.

It took me 3 months to read the book. I think it will take next 3 months to summarize.

# Book Summary

# Introduction

Businesses are opened by ordinary people like us. You don't need to fixate of getting a business angst, certification or imposter syndrome.

### You Don't Need To Know It All

Principles are less. Methods are too many. The one who knows principles can choose his own methods.

You do not need to learn everything. You only need to know a small set of business concepts.
