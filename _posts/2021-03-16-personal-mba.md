I had been thinking and writing a lot of article but the amount of time it was taking me was huge.

So, this book eliminates 80% of my future blog posts.

I realized that it would be better that starts with general ideas which I could later look deeply into.

There are total 271 concepts.

It took me 3 months to read the book. I think it will take next 3 months to summarize.

# Book Summary

# Introduction

Businesses are opened by ordinary people like us. You don't need to fixate of getting a business angst, certification or imposter syndrome.

### You Don't Need To Know It All

Principles are less. Methods are too many. The one who knows principles can choose his own methods.

You do not need to learn everything. You only need to know a small set of business concepts to make good decisions.

### No Experience Necessary

### Questions, Not Answers

Education is the answer to all questions not just one. If you know how to ask the right question, you'll find answers to your problems faster.

### Mental Models, not Methods

# Business

## Value Creation

## Marketing

Marketing is about finding the right prospespects, keeping their attention and make them interested in what you have to offer. Every business needs to do it because no matter how good your product is, you won't have profit until your customers can find you.

**Direct-Marketing** sometimes reduces the lines between itself and sales because it reduces amount of time to close the deal.

But overall, Marketing and Sales are completely different activities. Marketing is about keeping attention. Sales is about closing the deal.

> The product that does not sell without advertising. Will not sell with advertising.

### Attention

The number 1 rule of marketing is that attention is limited and every other company is trying to grab attention.

People are only interested in things they like and the things that are important to them. Therefore high quality attention is important. And high quality attention must be earned.

At the same time, the aim is not be popular. The aim is to increase profits. So if you can get yourself on TV, you'll be popular but you'll waste a lot of time not finding the **right customer**. 

## Receptivity

People ignore what they don't care about. 

Receptiveless is how open a person is to your message. There are three parts to this: message, timing and medium

**Message**: The person should be interested in the message you are offering.
**Timing**: The person should recieve the message at the right time.
**Medium**: The person should recieve message from the right medium. Example: A personlized message will likely be more effective than same commercial message to every person.

From a business perspective, you want your customers to be as receptive as possible.

## Remarkability

Remarkability is being enough different to pique the interest of your customers. Being remarkable voiletes customer's usual expectations and grabs their attention for free.

High remarkability generated word of mouth. Advertisement is what is done when you are not remarkable (or not remarkable enough).

## Probable Purchaser

Assuming everyone will purchase your product is bad. There are only a set of people who would. So it makes no sense to try to appeal to everyone.

Appeal to the right customer at the right time. Every good marketing compain does this.

## Preoccupation

Always assume that your prospect has preoccupied himself/herself with something. Your goal is to be interesting enough so that you can grab their attention.

The threshhold for this maybe low or high depending on your environment and type of product.

### Level of Awareness

You need to be sensitive to how much your probable customer cares about your offer.

There are 5 levels to this:
1. Unaware
2. Problem Aware
3. Solution Aware: Knows solution but not aware of specific offer
4. Offer Aware
5. Full Aware

Your goal is to identiy the level the prospect is at the push them towards upper level -> The **Funnel**.

The best way to do it is to personalize your message for each prospect and level.

### End Result

Humans don't always do what the think they are doing. Eg: People who buy SUV don't use it for it's purpose. They use it to feed their status.

Find out what they really desire and appeal to it.

Ankush: Combine this with Education Based Selling. You cannot sell loads of crap just because it makes someone feel high status.

### Demonstration

Demonstration is one of the oldest tricks which significantly increases probability of sale.

Demonstrate your product to the customer. Make them use it. Let them see the results themself. This removes a lot of doubts the prospect may have.

### Qualification

It is better to screen prospects and find the right customers that to have bad customers. This has to happen before sale.

Ideally your funnel should remove bad customer. Bad onces will consume un-neccesary time, attention and resources.

After that you can focus on better serving the right once.

The prospect who is not right for you may be right for your competitors. You don't have to be jumpy about not serving bad prospects, help them by refer them to competitors.
