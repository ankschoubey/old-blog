I had been thinking and writing a lot of article but the amount of time it was taking me was huge.

So, this book eliminates 80% of my future blog posts.

I realized that it would be better that starts with general ideas which I could later look deeply into.

There are total 271 concepts.

It took me 3 months to read the book. I think it will take next 3 months to summarize.

# Book Summary

# Introduction

Businesses are opened by ordinary people like us. You don't need to fixate of getting a business angst, certification or imposter syndrome.

### You Don't Need To Know It All

Principles are less. Methods are too many. The one who knows principles can choose his own methods.

You do not need to learn everything. You only need to know a small set of business concepts to make good decisions.

### No Experience Necessary

### Questions, Not Answers

Education is the answer to all questions not just one. If you know how to ask the right question, you'll find answers to your problems faster.

### Mental Models, not Methods

# Business

## Value Creation

## Marketing

Marketing is about finding the right prospespects, keeping their attention and make them interested in what you have to offer. Every business needs to do it because no matter how good your product is, you won't have profit until your customers can find you.

**Direct-Marketing** sometimes reduces the lines between itself and sales because it reduces amount of time to close the deal.

But overall, Marketing and Sales are completely different activities. Marketing is about keeping attention. Sales is about closing the deal.

### Attention

The number 1 rule of marketing is that attention is limited and every other company is trying to grab attention.

People are only interested in things they like and the things that are important to them. Therefore high quality attention is important. And high quality attention must be earned.

At the same time, the aim is not be popular. The aim is to increase profits. So if you can get yourself on TV, you'll be popular but you'll waste a lot of time not finding the **right customer**. 

## Receptivity

People ignore what they don't care about. 

Receptiveless is how open a person is to your message. There are three parts to this: message, timing and medium

**Message**: The person should be interested in the message you are offering.
**Timing**: The person should recieve the message at the right time.
**Medium**: The person should recieve message from the right medium. Example: A personlized message will likely be more effective than same commercial message to every person.

From a business perspective, you want your customers to be as receptive as possible.

## Remarkability

Remarkability is being enough different to pique the interest of your customers. Being remarkable voiletes customer's usual expectations and grabs their attention for free.

High remarkability generated word of mouth. Advertisement is what is done when you are not remarkable (or not remarkable enough).
