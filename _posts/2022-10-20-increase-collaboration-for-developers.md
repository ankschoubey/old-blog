title: Increase collaboration for Developers
---

Give everyone access to every other repo. Allow them to fork and update code and return with a merge request.

Allowing access also helps share snippet of code. Like how to test A would be available in one repo and can be shared.

# Embrace every level of DevOps.

That's easy. Each DevOps stage breaks some silo down.
- DevOps
- DevSecOps
- DevTestOps
- DevFinOps
- DevDevDevDevOpsOpsOpsOps
- AgileOps

# Embrace a cycle of continuous code review
Have a continuous humanised code review cycle
- Code review should be a continuous cycle
- Code review should be humanised

# If you see an error. Report it to the right person/place/raise ticket right away.

Who ever you want to increase collaboration with should be on speed-dial or pinned.

If you have opinions say it at last. Let everyone speak their minds freely.

You can say something like "Wait let me check"
