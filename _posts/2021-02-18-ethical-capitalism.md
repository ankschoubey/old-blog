ethical capitalism is a game everyone needs to win at.

The more you read about it the more you relize that these economic systems are designed to help people. And capitalism is a pure genius.


There are some issues where my brain in not he best fit. So I am trying to explore this area.


Capitalism involves pushing onewself to help others. That is what capitalist do.

 They build businesses that help other people.

They find a problem and solve it. How do you get rewarded. You get rewarded in from of money.

THouse who don't have their own business help others by becoming employee. They too add value.

Money is a proof that you are adding value to the world.

Capitalism is not perfect but it is better than anything other economic system.

Capitalism if not kept check can turn evil. Though ethics is not something that is intristic in capitalism.

And it amy probably never be included as it is hard to be laid out perfectly.

Ethics allows you to play long term game and be trust worth. Money is also a metric of trust.

A combination of the two leads to more result that one or the other.

Bezos vs Elon Musk.


The path is through money.

What are you going to do not earn?
