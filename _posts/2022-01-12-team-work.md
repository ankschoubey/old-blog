Learn how to talk to people

Good conversation is the best preparation for proper living. [^1]

Becoming Self Sustainable: 
You have to have self awareness first. Know about how you are. What are your stories. and then go out into the world to share it. Your goal is not to depend on people for your happiness. Your goal is to share your access happiness and joy.

Have a inner compass. 

You know what you did. You know exactly.

If you are ever tempted to look for outside approval, realize that you have compromised your integrity. If you need a witness, be your own.


Freedom means depending only on yourself:
- Financially
- Physically
- Emotionally

You can enjoy company. But you don't need it. -> Non-neediness

Then you can truely give unconditional love. Giving unconditional love is just as good as getting it.

Side effect and Goal : Avoid Drama


Have strong boundaries

Relationship: Pick the right person. Increase your standards from yourself. And choose wisely because this decision is very impactful.

 What is it that I have to give up to be with you? If it's too much, I'm good jus tbeing here.


 Don't be there for people who aren't there for you.

Be there for people who are there for you.

Relationship:
What 

Be a good neighbour:

But before preacing know that good avice at the wrong time is bad advice.

Be Open Minded

You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way it does not exist. [^2]

Don't fix their problem/please them: No one will chase you if you don't let them.

Win hearts on men

To gain confidence the leader must find a way to the hearts of his men. This he will do by acquiring an understanding of their thoughts and feelings and by showing constant concert for their comfort and welfare. [^3]

There are essentially 3 aims
1. Independence: Zero dependence
2. Assuming that you don't know
3. Have fun

| Aim                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Help                          | Ask for help. and help others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   |
| Low Dependence                | It's not ideal to be overdependent on anyone or let someone else be overdependent on you. <br>Dependence can be emotional, financial, etc.<br>You want to enable everyone including yourself to solve own problem.<br>It isn't fair to steal someone including your problem.  |   |
| Assuming that you do not know | This makes us a good listener. We shouldn't intrerrupt. Specially if                                                                                                                                                                                                          |   |
| No one is perfect             | Even after all this, we should know humans aren't perfect. A little kindness/compromise won't be a big deal. <br><br>One can be assertive and explain why despite their disagreement, they are willing to do something.                                                       |   |
| Fairly Fair Deals             | You want to win or you want to have a relationship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   |
| Have fun                      | Chill. Calm down. Have fun. Isn't this the whole point of being a social animal?                                                                                                                                                                                              |   |
