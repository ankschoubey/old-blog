Learn how to talk to people

Good conversation is the best preparation for proper living. [^1]

Becoming Self Sustainable: 
You have to have self awareness first. Know about how you are. What are your stories. and then go out into the world to share it. Your goal is not to depend on people for your happiness. Your goal is to share your access happiness and joy.

Have a inner compass. 

You know what you did. You know exactly.

If you are ever tempted to look for outside approval, realize that you have compromised your integrity. If you need a witness, be your own.


Freedom means depending only on yourself:
- Financially
- Physically
- Emotionally

You can enjoy company. But you don't need it. -> Non-neediness

Then you can truely give unconditional love. Giving unconditional love is just as good as getting it.

Side effect and Goal : Avoid Drama


Have strong boundaries

Relationship: Pick the right person. Increase your standards from yourself. And choose wisely because this decision is very impactful.

 What is it that I have to give up to be with you? If it's too much, I'm good jus tbeing here.


 Don't be there for people who aren't there for you.

Be there for people who are there for you.

Relationship:
What 

Be a good neighbour:

But before preacing know that good avice at the wrong time is bad advice.

Be Open Minded

You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way it does not exist. [^2]

Don't fix their problem/please them: No one will chase you if you don't let them.

Win hearts on men

To gain confidence the leader must find a way to the hearts of his men. This he will do by acquiring an understanding of their thoughts and feelings and by showing constant concert for their comfort and welfare. [^3]

There are essentially 3 aims
1. Independence: Zero dependence
2. Assuming that you don't know
3. Have fun

| Aim                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |   |

| Low Dependence                | It's not ideal to be overdependent on anyone or let someone else be overdependent on you. <br>Dependence can be emotional, financial, etc.<br>You want to enable everyone including yourself to solve own problem.<br>It isn't fair to steal someone including your problem.  |   |
| Assuming that you do not know | This makes us a good listener. We shouldn't intrerrupt. Specially if                                                                                                                                                                                                          |   |
| No one is perfect             | Even after all this, we should know humans aren't perfect.

| Fairly Fair Deals             | You want to win or you want to have a relationship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   |

Add avoid drama to above list.




Stand up for others

You can disagree with someone but still support them for the choice they make. Disagreement should not destroy friendship.


Do not change yourself for worse.

In relationships we get bad and change. This shouldn't happen as it's bad for us and bad deal for other person.

make stuff easy for others and yurself.

Learn compassion. What do x need?


Make her fall in love with you. Master attraction but only for her.

Buy you should keep her sepeate from your manly goals. You have your goals. No one else does.

Pay undividend attention.

Take care of people around you.

Team work/people things is a dichotemy.

Be there for your team and ask them for problems.


You can practice team work by:
- Playing team sports and games
- Being social more



If you wish to lead:
Lead by example. Don't force. You can tell. But you should force. You are reducing your value by doing that.

Be strict with yourself and not with others. Be even less strict with family and maybe lesser with children.

Be patient with people. Give people time to think. Everyone including yoruself needs time to think.


Express and represent your self well. it matter a lot.


Be really good at comminicateing in every medium.

Get your point across. Learn from people who are good.

Give people proper Time and attention. Giving them less time may not be helpful



After disagreement, how to make sure things are right?
How big of a deal was it?
How can I make sure person feels safe?
Am I being overprotective now?


You should not interrupt someoen while they talk. Specially when they are in heat. Because you are assuming you already know what they are thinking. Really? You can do what current science cannot? this is rude.


Art of makign friends: Art of building trust.
Trust given too easily is not rewarded. No one, including you, likes free. People like challenge and people like to trust when they have build trust themselves. So let them put effort if they are putting effort. DOn't discourage even if from your side you have trust in them. There are to be proper/concrete foundation that both can recall and assert the trust/trustworthy past actions. Build trust through actions. never through words.


Forgive forget and build truth again.

Team work is a possitive sum game. Treat it as such.
