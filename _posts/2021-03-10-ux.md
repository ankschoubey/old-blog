I started learning about UX a few months ago. This post summarizes things I have learned far.

## User Experience

User Experience (UX) is about making a product or service in a way that is useful, easy and delightful for end users.

UX is something that has to be actively worked on. It won't happen automatically.

Because if UX is not good,
- User will get frustrated using the product
- User will not find the product attractive to use.

And therefore they won't use your product.

## Sympathize with the user.

The way to understand what the users want is by sympathizing with the struggles that user's face.

## Test fast

The earlier you can get feedback from the user, the shorter your product development cycle will be.

The user can only know what he/she likes when he/she can experience the product. But since product development takes resources, prototyping helps to make the process faster.

The fastest way to do it is to create paper prototypes. Paper is inexpensive, quick and has zero learning curve. 

You can prototype not just User Interface but also physical products.

Once the paper prototype is created, you can increase the fidelity of the prototypes. 

> If a picture can say a thousand words, a prototype can save a thousand meetings.

It's best to involve the end-users as much as possible in the design process.

The prototype also helps engineers to build exactly what the end-users want and reduces overall development time.

## UI is part of UX, not the other way around.

UX includes more than the User Interface. It includes every interaction the user has with the product or the company.

UX is concerned with how the user feels when using the product and not just how it looks.

Such things can include reducing the number of steps needed to perform a task.
