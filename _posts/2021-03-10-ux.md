I started learning about UX a few months ago and this post is a summarizes of things I have learned far.

## User Experience

User Experience (UX) is about making a product or service in a way that is useful, easy and delightful for end users.

UX is something that has to be actively focused on. 

Because if UX is not good,
- User will get frustrated using the product
- User not find product attractive to use.

And therefore they won't use your product.

## Emphatise with the user.

The way to understand what the users what is by emphatising with struggles that user's face.

## Test fast

The earlier you can get feedback from the user, the shorter your product development cycle will be.

The user can only know what he/she likes when he/she can experience the product. But since product development takes resources, prototyping helps to make the process faster.

The fastest way to do it is use paper prototypes. Paper is inexpensive, quick and has zero learning curve. 

You can prototype not just User Interface but also physical products.

It's best to involve the end users as much as possible in the design process.

## UI is part of UX not the other way around.

Center justification is bad if there are too many things center justified.
