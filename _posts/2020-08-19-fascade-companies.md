Companies which don’t actually care about solving a problem.

They are here only for money, increasing valuation, getting more investor, getting sales by tactics such as selling themselves (coupons), brand brand, social media post.

Then when everything is all set, the founders will exit without hesitation. Not because the problem has been solved but because they didn’t care about the solving the problem at all. It was just a facade.
