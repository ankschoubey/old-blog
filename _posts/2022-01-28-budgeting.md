Many times discussing governments spending, it is discussed how while a budget was allocated, the government didnâ€™t spend as much or they spent more.

For example, the Education budget was set at 20 billion but only 5 billion was spent. Or they overspent which ate up other areas.

Usually, these discussions assume that spending the complete budget allocated is best.

- **Underspending**: Not doing enough
- **Overspending**: Doing too much and eating into other areas.

The same can be applied to resources of one's #life.

I believe these are the most important resources a person spends on.

- Time Budget
- Attention Budget
- Money Budget

So, given the premise above, the goal is to have a specific time, attention, and money budget for each important area of life and major activity. It isn't ideal to set budgets for everything (else you won't have an attention budget).

Time (in hours) and money (in currency) are easily quantifiable. Attention isn't.

For attention, the game becomes imaginary.

There are a few ways to imagine this:

1. Count the number of decisions in a day:
    - Imagine you have 100 decision points in a day.
    The more number decisions you take, the probability of you making a bad decision increases.
2. Number of context switching
    - Multitasking is the worst
