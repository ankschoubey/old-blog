Building software is having no fixed deadline. Below are some reasons why.

## Software vs Physical Products

Software products are hard to wrap the head around when compared to physical products.

A physical product occupies physical space which of course software does not.

Once a physical product is made, unless it is designed for modification, it cannot be modified.

The software can be modified and improved at any time.

## There is always something to do

When you look for problems to solve, you're sure to find something.
- Optimize code.
- Clean code up and make ready for the future.
- Fix bugs.

And it can be hard at times to stop.

## Over Engineering

Something can be built easily but we spend a lot of time deciding what the future thing might be and then we over-engineer.

I have been guilty too.

## The reason to stop.

It is said that in any software product around 70% of features are not used.

Many software themselves are not used.

Time spent fixing this trivial non-existent problem can be spent fixing some other big problems.

## Human Intuitions and Definition of Done

Humans can find ways to improve everything. Our judgment is not objective. We need something objective.

Having a strong definition of done can help be objective.
