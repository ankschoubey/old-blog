```java
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = head;
        
        while(current!=null){
            ListNode tempCurrent = current.next;
            
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            
            current = tempCurrent;
        }
        return prev;        
    }
