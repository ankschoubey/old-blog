The time it takes to hurry is 

Hurring is similar to stock market investing.

If you hurry you make profit some times and you losses some times. In the end you are in the same place.

Watching YouTube videos at 2x speed won't help. Specially if it is a field you are not familiar with.

If you write super fast thinking you'll not be able to understand what you wrote.

If you read too fast. You won't have enough comprehention.

There is a point before you rush. The minimum effective dose.
