# Calm down

If you don't know what to say. Calm down. Maybe take a break. And then tell the truth truthfully and in a good way.

Become neutral. Aim to be non-reactive to threats on any kind be it people or situations.

Calm down and thing.

# Slow down

You aren't running a race. Take things slow and steady.

This is easier to remember that to actually do it in practice. Slow down.

Go very slow. Remember, slow is smooth. And smooth is fast.

# Explore and eliminate insecurities

Insecurity is chasing the impossible.

Insecurities come from unrealistic expectations. If you are someone productive, you can't expect to be good at 20 other things. specially if 15 of those things are stupid.

Ask yourself, are you insecure or someone made you insecure? Was it a person, advertisement, advice, etc.

Remember: Insecurity = Someone is trying to sell you something.

A practice to do is, question every ad.
- Does it make sense.

You become more secure when no one can sell you anything.
