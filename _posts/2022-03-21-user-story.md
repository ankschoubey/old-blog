title: Thoughts & Notes on User Stories
---

I have had a love-hate relationship with Agile. The reason has likely been I didn't realize it's effectiveness.

These are my thoughts and notes on User Stories. I hope to improve and expand on these ideas in upcoming months.

# User Stories

The goal with user story is to deliver the best value in smallest/most efficient package.

This would void un-neccesary rework, make sure we start the story at the right time and help make estimate for how much work can be done within a fixed time.

The lessons one can gain from creating user stories, splitting, making DOD, making DOR, etc are all transferable skill to personal planning as well.

# Size of User Stories

INVEST is a good acronymn to start with to decide how big story should be.

- Independent
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimatable
- Small
- Testable

# Writing User Stories

Guiding phrases help narrow focus. 

The description can be phrased this way.

```java
    As a <user>
    I want <outcome>
    so that <business>
```

Often `<outcome>` can be used as story title.

# Definition Of Ready

Definition of Ready is when it's right to start a user story. We don't want to have a lot of context switches because it reduces productivity.

U-INVEST

The invest remains same as sizing of stories.

The U is for User Interface.

# Definition of Done

Defination of done is when we can say the story ended.

The following I believe is must.

- TDD followed
- Deployed
- Product Owner Accepted Story
