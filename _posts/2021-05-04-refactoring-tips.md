# Refactoring Code Effective 

It may be good to have unit test cases

Study the code layout.

Create base classes, Interfaces etc

Create your own library

Make Copy of Classes. 
Refactoring is easier with Injectables. Just create a new class.

Commit in small increments.

Continuously Integrate your code

Refactor one functionality at once instea dof everything at once.
