My first piece of code was a calculator in Visual Basic. It was 2005 and I was in 4th grade. My father sat beside be and taught me how to make it.

Then after a year or so, in Mumbai Mirrors Newspaper's Sci-Tech section there was a piece on a kids programming language called Scratch.edu.

I went out playing that morning and told my friend that I'll be building my own GTA Vice City.

These are the few things I published on Scratch.

# 3D Project

I did not post this but I remember it well.

I created a room layout. A rectangular box in middle and 3 lines from corner of image to corner of rectangle.

When I pressed up key, the image zoomed in. I hoped to make more changes such that it would looked like that old Wolf Dom Game.

My first real taste of programming was first year of Diploma (11th Grade) in C language.
