title: Why Engineers should get into other field.

## Computer Engineers solve problems by building software solutions.-

We then take those solutions and make it more efficient.

We also create alternative solutions that replaces the original solutions.

All of these is done fast, every fast. 

We hypothesis, test on small scale. test on big scale, fast and then test in real workd.

If a demand is unreasonable, we still get it done.

If the deadline is really near, we get it done.

## How other field can benefit

This is because of the nature of software and the core of engineering is to solve problem as easily as possible and in the best way as possible.

Any software enginner talking to business users/consumer the people, the who actually use our product, realizes quickly a that they are not using the product to it's fullest or they don't know that the problems they are facing can be easily solved with help of computer technology.

## Some field are getting stagnated. 

There is a long delay in medical research getting to production. (Approx 20 year) [^1]

There hasn't been much innovation in field like health care, ivil engineer or biotechnology
