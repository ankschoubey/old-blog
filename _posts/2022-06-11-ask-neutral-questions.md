title: Become a better listener by asking neutral questions
---

To understand neutral questions it’s more effective to understand it’s alternative. Loaded questions.

A loaded question is where you already pick a side.

For example:

Loaded:

> My friend lied to me about having a job. What should I do in this situation?

Neutral:

> If someone lies about themselves? What should be done? Or how should one think about it?

Two techniques:

1. Remove references. Keep everything third person.

2. Use phrases like how should one think about this.
