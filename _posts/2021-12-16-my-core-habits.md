These are habits that have or I am trying to develop to make my core values second nature. I want these to be intuitive without hard and extremely strict rules.

## Responsibility
- Take care of yourself like someone you take care of: Ultimate Responsibility.
- Define what's not your responsibility
    - Over worrting/trying to solve other people problem/forcing them to change is not your responsibility. Though you can serve as an example.

- Listen to your conscience (the critic), what's the things in front of you (however small) that you haven't fix? Fix them. Fix the smallest first.

## Peace
- Judge Less
- Empty your mind
- Reframe Everything
    - Choose your damn limitation
- Rely of decision making frameworks
- Detach and prioritize
- Love everything that happens (Amor Fati)
- Is this worth your time and mental strain
- Have activites be complete in themselves. You do it not because you want to gain something else from it.


## Systems
- Break down everything into small chunks. What's the smallest thing I can do to move a step forward. 1% Better


## Telling the truth and being hyper realistic
- Tell the truth
- Speak up
- Read diffucult books
- Talk to different people


## Courage is Calling (Courage is exciting)
- Exercise
- Cold Shower
- Work on most important task and push yourself.
- Avoid slipups and stand back up quickly after one.
- Do the right thing because it is the right thing. Let go of the outcome.
- Requires attitude of being a monster

## Time Matters
- Remember you can't live forever
- Complete things on a daily bases
- Don't wait for more than 5 minutes if you texted and not available. 3 min is better.
- Ask yourself is this essential

I waste time mostly in these ways:

- Waiting for circumstances to be right before taking action.
    - The best time to take action was yesterday, the second best time is today.
- Over-caring what other people think.
- Being too emotional
- Constantly changing direction completely for no apparent reason
