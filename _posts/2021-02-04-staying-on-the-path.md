## The Path

The path is trying to be the best version of yourself.

## Why 

If you are not the best you can be, you create or neglect problems. These problems accumulate and will make you suffer. And it's not just you who will suffer. It will engulf all the people around you.

Therefore, it's an ethical crime to be weak[^3] and not be the best version of yourself.

## Consistency

dThe reason to be consistent is that you experience compount effect. Small changes overtime can significantly change things.

Look at yourself from 5 years ago. Any habit that was small would have been really small for the first 2 years. then suddently it started growing significantly.

Things that at first don't seem significant become significant when you compound them over a few years.

So if you are cleaning your room, planning the day, meditating, etc. You are on the path! Their is light at the end of the tunnel.

## Staying on the Path

## Sacrifice

You have to give up who you are to be who you want to be.

### The Dark Side

The dark side is the easy path. It's a path devoid of responsibility. Blame, complain and general disinterest is forms of the dark side. 

### Humility

One is tempted to go to the dark side when he/she is not humble.

if not one overestimated himself.

One should try fixing problems around him starting from the smallest. Smallest problems like making your bed make a man humble.

### Taking on the burden
There is a difference between being handed something and taking it on voluntarily. 

One should take on the burden voluntarily because what is neglected is rushes in when things go bad. [^3]

## Default Aggresive

Be the one who does things. Who solves the problems. Not the one who just reacts to the the situations.
