## The Path

The path is trying to be the best version of yourself.

## Why 

If you are not the best you can be, you create or neglect problems. These problems accumulate and they make you suffer. And it's not just you who will suffer, it will engulf all the people around you.

Therefore, it's an ethical crime to not be the best version of yourself.

## Staying on the Path

## Taking on Responsibility

The boy shall die and the man will live.

### The Dark Side

The dark side is the easy path. It's a path devoid of responsibility. Blame. complaining, and general disinterest in the dark side. 

### Humility

One is tempted to go to the dark side when he/she is not humble.

if not one overestimated himself.

One should try fixing problems around him starting from the smallest. Smallest problems like making your bed make a man humble.

### Taking on the burden

There is a difference between being handed something and taking it on voluntarily. One should take on the burden voluntarily because what is neglected is rushes in when things go bad.
