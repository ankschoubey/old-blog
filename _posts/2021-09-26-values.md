This is something I have been developing for a few months [^2]. But later I found out this is pretty common thing. Many of my recent discoveries/realizations have come from Subtle art of Not Giving A Fuck.

# What are values?

Values are often hidden, sometimes unknown, highly personal frame with which people operate. Our values define who we are and what choices we'll make in different situations.

Values apply to everything we do. Be it known or unknown scenarios.

If you are faced with a problem that you have already solved, then you'll rely on your past experience or skill for it. If you are faced with an unknown problem, then you'll rely on your values. Therefore it is important to conciously develop your value and choose better ones.

If you don't choose our values well, we give a fuck about too many things. Most of those things are un-neccessary and make us unhappy.

Therefore, choosing your values is choosing what to give a fuck about and that inturn makes us have a more meaningful life.

Exploring and choosing your values leads the highest level of self-awareness where you move beyond what you feel and why you feel a certain way.

# Good and Bad Values

| Good Values                                                                                    | Bad Values                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Socially Constructive                                                                          | Socially Destructive                                      |
| Based on reality/truth                                                                         | Superstitious                                   |
| Requires work internally aka on oneself. Doesn't rely on external people, events or scenarios being a certain way. | Depends heavily on external events, people and scenarios to be a certain way. |
| Since it's internal: it's immediate and controllable | Since it's not internal: It's not immediate or controllable|
| Example: Honesty                                                                               | Example: Not being alone for a while.                     |

For each value we choose or decide to choose, we can run through the list and decide if it's good or bad.

# Implementing values

## Focus on the value rather the specific scenarios/tip

Learn to resist searching for specific scenarious/tip, focus on value instead. Specific scenarious/tip apply to certain situations. Values would apply to every situation.

Living your values doesn't have to involve infinite googling. It does require infinite introspection.

## Try coming up with own strategies

Every values is going to be a collection of micro-routines and habits. Many of these habits are going to be something that you have for 20+ years.

And a lot of it is going to be modified or changed on a on going basis.

So, you'll have to come up with your own set of strategies first. This will require some first-principle thinking. And often require modification to small things.

Habits are the best way to enforce a value/identity. As you repeat an habit, you find more and more evidence of your new value.

## CRUD your values over time

CRUD is a programming term which stands for create, read, update and delete.

As you grow, you'll have access to new information. Sometimes you may even find the value is no longer surving it's purpose.

Similarly, sometime you may find slightly changing your values gives it new meaning. #likeAGoodVariableName

## Learn to identify values

Learn to identify values in yourself and in others.

How?
1. Look at a piece or a set of actions. Resist the urge to look at what the person is saying.
2. Determine what much be a common value supporting the value.
3. Resist the urge to have a backstory.
4. Determine if the value is good or bad.

Having a backstory provides a justification. Values aren't about justifying the past or present. It's about how one acts.

Example 1: //TODO

> Ankush is a honest person. He says honest. Ankush seems to tell everything non-stop. Even at times where it's hard or difficult. Sometimes, he's too bluent that makes him disconnect with people. Even his close family members and friends find it hard to bear him sometimes. When they do bring something up, he attacks. This makes people not wanna tell him truth. But Ankush does think about what they said and scrutinize it. When he realizes he's wrong or likely wrong, he does tell people that they were right. But sometimes it's too late.

Here it seems:
1. Ankush is honest.
2. And at the same time Ankush doesn't care for other people's feelings enough.
3. And insecure about being wrong/critized.
4. But it seems sometimes he realized he's wrong and does say he's wrong and apologized.

Therefore a few values some up:
- Honesty
- Not caring about other people's feelings
- Handing early critisim with attack
- Probably trust issue with other people's opinion early on. (needs to think things completely to accept)

Example 2:

> Mayur is someone who takes good care of himself. He dresses sharp. Goes to the gym for exercise regularly. 

// TODO

# Good values/identities

Often the reason we can't let go of some behaviour/value is because we have tried it up to hard to our identity.

It takes a lot of effort to understand and reavaluate our identity.

Therefore it's important to pick and choose and keep our values/identity general.

Example:
- Your identity should not be linked to a specific person or thing or activity.
Example: Being a programmer.
- Your identity should be linked with a character: like Honesty, Discipline.

Good identities are long term, internal and based on common good.

- Long Term: Even if things seem bad in the short term. Things would be better in the long term.
- Internal: No one else needs to execute on my value. I am the only one in control here.
- Common Good: Acting on my value improves my life and of everyone involved.
- Activity/Habit: Something that is necessary and repeatable. 


# Resistance and strong boundaries

In real world, you'll often be faced with choices that temp you to not take on your choose value.

This could be but not limited to:
1. A situation
2. A person

Choose the good value here.

Following values is being at the center of order and chaos. Good would come out of following a well chosen value. Choosing a value is struggle you take on.

Each decision is a test of your value.

## Humans are not a rational agent

Humans are only rational agent only withing the scenario he/she is in aka local minima.

By not choosing a set of guidelines/principles/values once chooses to be nothing. One has to give up the idea of being everything. And rather be something.

## Values simplify decision making

Values are things that you regard highly and that you don’t compromise on. They can act as rough guidelines for making decisions. And also serve as a standard to judge your actions on.

Every individual is different, therefore it is important to build your own set of values to follow. Don't borrow someone's values. Define your own.

To have your values articulated, means you can use them much more easily into making decisions.

While this post talks about personal values, same can be applied to businesses.

"Core values are choices you make"

## Some use cases for values

You can compare your core values with someone to see how aligned you are. Usually of you are aligned things to smoothly. [^1]

You can usually pick up other’s value if you listen to them cuz most people essentially speak the same things over and over again.

If you have a particularly bad event, you can verify your actions on your values. You may find that you might not have lived up to your values fully. Or it maybe time to tweak your value a bit.

Each and every decision you make is a vote for or against a value. Don't vote for what you don't want.

## Tips for Finding and Picking Values

These are some of my tips for picking values:

### Pick only a few values at first

- I would recommend 3-4 at first and then adding a few overtime as need arises.
- To pick the most personalized values, look at your past events. What motivated you make certain decisions?

Shorter the length of each value the easier you can remember. Lesser the number of values, more you can remember.

### Reframe your values to fit perfectly

- Test and modify for your values. Maybe adding a few words would solidify a value which was previously too vague.
- I have renamed my values multiple times where they essentially mean the same thing but with words that make more sense.

### Keep them as abstract as possible

- The more abstract your values, the more decisions you can slot in to them.

### Compress. Don’t add a new value unless you absolutely need it

- Value discovery is like finding new elements. You don’t want to add a new element if a value already exists.

### Build habits around them

You want your core values to be second nature. Build habits around each of them so that they stick long term. Habits need not be long, they need to be second nature.

### Here are a few things I discovered:
- I can develop habits around my values. -> Identity Level Change
- I can have a few people to look up to for each of my values. This is because visualizing becomes easier.
- I can make my core values my standard.
- While trying to decide if should follow a value, I can think og the best thing that would habppend and the worst thing that would happen.
- All values boil down to choosing long term over short term.[^1]
