title: How to be more inviting
---

# Make yourself available

Instead of hiding yourself. Be more open.

This includes real world and digital world too.

Real World: Be open to going out, making plans and meeting people.

Digitally: This includes but isn't limited to setting your status as "Available" on Teams/Google Chat #postPandemicWorld

# Help/Guide people

Help/Guide people who need it. The goal isn't the get "praised". The goal is solving of problems.

Focus on solving of problems and help everyone. Another positive of helping everyone is you don't expect anything back.
