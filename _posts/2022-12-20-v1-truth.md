Treat this article as a buffet. Start with the introduction and then read the sections until you feel you get the gist. Then jump to the next.

## Introduction

There are two parts to truth:

1. Seeing the truth
2. Speaking the truth
3. Acting the truth

## Seeing the truth

On truth, we want to be able to see truth as clearly as we can always. How to achieve this.

Part of it can be automated. Part of it can’t be automated.

### Observability

Data collection on computers/mobile devices can be automated. For example, you can keep track of all the tasks you need to do. All of them.

Many people don’t write todolist. They think that tasks accomplish automatically. But most time they don’t. I decided to make change to my passport address an year ago and it’s still not done. Similarly I had decided to get a complete health checkup an year ago. That hasn’t happened yet.

The goal with todo list is clarity. If we are failing towards our goal, we should know. If we are not failing towarding our goal we should know.

Similarly, all the quantified self automated systems are also truths.

### Rational Pre-decisions

There are other ways to see truth aswell. For example, you predecide that the person who loves you would make time for you. Now, if they don’t make time for you, you know they don’t love you or at least that they might be busy. #loveLanguages

It’s important to not move your goal posts too much here. A little nuance adjustment is okay. But rationalization is not.

### Hold opinions lightly

To see truth clearly, you have to hold you opinions lightly. Because when you start saying and speaking the truth, you’ll start seeing everything in absolute clarity and that clarity means most times you realize you were either wrong and not perfect.

## **The Mountain of Perspectives**: What is true?

We are in a 3 dimensional landscape. There are multiple people in it. And their are multiple mountains.

These mountains are truths. Some mountain are tall. Some are short.

People are distributed accross the terrain. Some can see one mountain clearly. Some can't. Some can see some part of the mountain.

On this terrain, if someone is tied, fog appears and they can't see the mountain clearly at that moment.

Therefore ultimately, we find that there's no one mountain. What's truth for one person may not be true for other. And the interpretation of what's true may change as more information is gathered.

This can be tricky when you first start with telling the truth. But you'll get the hang of it.

## What should you do to seek truth?

We can control a few variables.

1. Hold your opinions lightly and examine them regularly.
2. Filter out Logical Fallacies. Fallacies are very easier to spot and you'll sharpen your arguments.
3. Ask good questions that aren't biased.
4. Ask other's for advice.

## Still not convinced? Why we should always strive to tell the truth?

**Living and speaking your truth makes you free**: Why lie when you can tell the truth and be free? And it will make things better? That's double bonus.

**Telling the truth is acceptance of how things actually are**: We are always asked to accept reality as it is. Acceptance helps us get clearer helping us make better decisions and avoid traps.

**Truth always comes in the long run.**: No matter what you do, truth will eventually come out.

**Your body can feel when you are lying**.: When you lie or do something that is not truthful, your body reacts. Let's say you hate something and you are not saying it. You'll develop resentment and stress.

**If we are not truthful, someone else will suffer**: The cost of lying isn't something we always bear in the short term. Sometimes it's others. Suppose you go to a doctor, and he doesn't tell you that you might be in serious risk of a deadly disease and that now is a good time to avoid drinking? What impact would it have on you?

**Living and speaking truthfully orients you properly**:

If you can't lie, you'll hesitant to slack of at work if you want to face daily standup the next day. Thus, orienting you to become a better person and get work done.

If you can't live a lie, you won't cheat on exams. This will orient you properly to become the kind of person that will pass the exam.

{% include note.html content="Remember this always, if you speak the truth and act in truthful ways, the world will arrange itself in the best possible manner to you.<br>If you lie or don’t live truthfully, the world will arrange in the worst possible manager." %}

**Truth is a shield. That survives scrutiny**. 

That protects you against lie of any kind.

Truth and peace are directly correlated. One increases or decreases another.

## How we usually avoid telling the truth and what we can do about it?

**White Lies**: We should instead be as kind as possible but not lie. It's important to recognize that white lies backfire bigger than just speaking the truth.

## **Optional**: Psychological Safety: Helping others tell you truth

Psychological safety allows people to be themselves around you because they feel safe.

Offer guidelines and offer support.

Be consistent.

Tell your people you can handle the truth. Say it out loud. Over and over again. And mean it.

People who seek feedback more often feel psychologically safer.

Critize yourself publically.

## **Optional**: Zero Trust: Catching lies, liars and protecting yourself

Liars can wrap you and your world view to get what they want. They often go un-noticed. They are like successful social black-hat hackers. You need good security to protect yourself.

{% include note.html content="There is a difference between not knowing the truth" %}

You need zero trust. Zero trust that has 3 ideas.

![Zero Trust](/images/v1-truth/zero-trust.png)

{% include info.html content="Zero Trust is a concept in computer security used to protect distributed systems in cloud infrastructure. We can apply the same concepts to regular life." %}

- **Verify Explicitly**: Have explicit systems to verify if what is spoken is true. Pull out your logical fallacies and cognitive bias lists.
- **Least Privilage**: You don't have to say everything to everyone. Only give people as much access as they need. They don't need everything. They don't need your full self. Your family needs your full self, not others. You need to be assertive.
- **Assume Breach**: Assume the person you are talking to has tendency to lie. Or atleast has tendency to speak truthfully as deligently as you do.

**Catching a liar**:

Lies are oversimplistic and tend to change overtime.

- The liar has to keep a narrative of manything that aren't true.
- When pressed, they may try to blame on something else or bring up a totally irrelavent topic to distract us or place a straw man.
- They won't be specific.
- They may twist their words slightly to fit their lie into truth. At such moments, note if they have a motivated reasoning.

Should you confront a liar? Depends on how serious the lie was?

{% include tip.html content="Stay away from people who explicitly lie or have manipulative behavior." %}

**Gain perspectives**:

If you have a good social connections, you'll eventually know many common lies that other's face.

Books like 48 Laws of Power and Law of Human Nature are also helpful here.

## Implementing Truth

**It's easier to stop lying than it is to tell the truth**: Because most times you don't know what truth is. So, if you stop lying, you eliminate almost everything. What remains is as true as things can be.

**Practicing speaking the truth as clearly as you can**: Take a step back and think through if what you are saying is truth. Truth is clear and precise.

In order to be able to search for the truth, you have to think. To think, **you have to risk being offensive** sometimes.

In order to speak the truth, **you have to give up on what you want**.

**Tell the truth + be useful**: You can always laugh. Panic is no good. Seeking truth is difficult when you are in panic.

## Optional: Flavours of Truth That We Fail to Accept

**Data**: Data can be in many forms. It can be text/numbers from a system or it can be observation from a real event. If you can't see someone is continously treating you badly, you should accept that they treat you improperly. :)

**Rejection**: Rejection is a truth. No matter at what stage it is. This could be failure in an exam or a failure of relationship. The most rational thing to do here is to accept the rejection and move on. This acceptance is the acceptance of truth. Once we do accept it, we'll be able to rethink things though and move forward.

**Our Desires**: We try not to accept our desires. Maybe you wanna have sex badly but you force yourself not to think about it. Thus this thought becomes your new prison. Instead, you can accept this fact and find a healthier alternative than to watch porn :).

## Speaking Your Truth

Use simpler straight forward words.

You can’t make others see the truth easily. Saying, “You don’t want to look at truth” might be helpful sometimes but not often. This is because truth is filtered by many personal biases and personal knowledge.

For example, if someone has not experience pain of a loss, they won’t realize what you are going through. They won’t be able to empathize. And similarly, in such situations, you won’t be able to empathize with them.


## Optional: Nuances about Truth

**Don’t be idealistic be realist**. Being ideastic is great for personal discipline. Bt specially with others it becomes too much.

**Truth is good. But Panic is No Good**: You have to learn to be calm. And specially making someone else panic is no good. We are more likely to create something outof nothing when we panic. In that sense, we are creating truth from a lie.

**Belief presupposes truth**: Knock on the door and the door shall open. If you knock the right doo

## Optional: Truth and Other Concepts

**Ego**: Ego stops us from getting to the truth. To avoid ego, hold your opinions lightly.

**Biases**: Biases are blindspots we have.

**Truth and Good are tied**:

If you are asked if you should lie for the greater good? And you say yes.

Maybe, you are on the extreme.

**Truth and Peace are tied**:

The closer you are the truth. The more peaceful you are inside.

## Conclusion

We should tell the truth because:

1. Staying connected with reality is the best place to make wise decisions.

Truth is:

1. Based on reality and true events.
2. Based on the recognition of personal biases and fallacies.
3. Based on the recognition that we are more likely wrong given the amount of info in the world.
4. Empirical, i.e. verifiable in the real world.

Truth is not based on the following:

1. Self-affirmations and beliefs
2. Motivated reasoning.
3. Commenting without doing.
