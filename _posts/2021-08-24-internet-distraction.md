The following should reduce influence of recommender systems significantly. Making internet less distracting and help improve privacy.

## Least Access Principle

This is a security principle.

By default, the number of accesses granted to a user/role/application should be least needed to run that application.

The more access someone/something has, the more will be probability of a security risk.

## Reduce Data Points

A recommender system can only work with data we provide. If data is reduced, it will have hard time figuring out what to recommend therefore making things less distracting.

## Specifics

### Phone

- Do not allow notifications
- Do not give any permission for the application if it is not necessary.
- For iOS 14.5+: Turn off app tracking for all apps

## For Services

- Turn off personalized ads
- Do not store unnecessary data. Even after deleting, most services will take 6 months to delete it from all their servers.

For Example: In YouTube you can,

- Delete all playlists
- Unsubscribe from all channels
- Change locations to some other country (I Choose Japan)
- Turn off Personalized Ads

I found that Google services are good at providing these kind of features and changing these settings have an immediate effect. Facebook Products and Amazon hide a lot of details.

# Resources

- [Remove the explore page from Instagram on iOS : ios](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/t780bt/remove_the_explore_page_from_instagram_on_ios/)
- [Block Site - Stay Focused - Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site-stay-focused/offfjidagceabmodhpcngpemnnlojnhn)

Set it up such that the tab autocloses. Because this reduces a touch point.

Once you realize you had opened a distracting website. Take a moment to notice, what were you thinking or feeling just before opening.

Was it because something that requires relatively-hard thinking came along and your brain decided to switch to something known and easy?
