If you are having a deal or an agreement or a negotiation of some kind. Do it via email. If you had communication offline or via another medium that is not documented, send a mail stating the minutes of the meeting and agreement. If necessary ask for a confirmation reply.

I used to think this is disrespectful as I had communication with the person offline but as humans, we all of us forget. The email is for your future and the receiver's future self.

In case, if a person or company denies the deal you have a written "official" mail. He cannot repudiate it.

Most people and companies are normal but some are malevolent. You'll thank your past self of the email.

To not look robotic, mention to the person that you'll be dropping a mail mentioning these points and would require confirmation.

I learned this from my managers and my father.
