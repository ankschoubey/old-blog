If you are having a deal or an agreement or a negotiation of some kind. **Do it via email**.

If you had communication offline or via another medium that is not documented, send a mail stating the minutes of the meeting and agreement.

If necessary ask for a confirmation reply.

## Why?

I used to think this is disrespectful as I most of the time I had communication with the person offline but as humans, **we all of us forget**.

The email is for your future and the receiver's future self.

In case, if a person or company or even you yourself deny the deal, you have a written "official" mail which cannot be repudiated.

Most people and companies are normal but some are malevolent. You'll thank your past self for the email.

## If you had offline interation

To not look robotic, mention to the person that you'll be dropping a mail mentioning discussed points and would require confirmation.

<sup>I learned this from my managers and my father.</sup>
