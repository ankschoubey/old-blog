Money üí∞ is a form of value. If enough people become interested in a form of value, that value is called money. This value/money can be exchange for goods/services.

Once upon a time, sea shells üêö were used as value/money.

Money is only valuable when it is limited. If there is infinite money, the value of each individual unit will reduce and you need more money in exchange of same value.

Simplified example, imagine there if there is 1000 unit of a currency in circulation. 

At this place, 1 unit buys you a house.

Let‚Äôs suppose, the government decided to print more money and now 1000 more printed units are being added. 

Now, the same house will hypothetically require 2 units of currency.

The value of single unit was reduced by half.

To avoid this, previously hold was used to set an upper limit. But around 1960s gold was removed because governments could not simply print money to pay of their debts.

This got called as Fiat currency. The current which has no backing. Enough people believe in the value of the fiat currency, therefore it is used ad money.

Essentially with fiat currency like dollar, government make life easier for them but at the same time make life difficult for normal people holding the money.

Bitcoin and crypto currency remove this power from the government and decentralize it amoung individuals.

Bitcoin can only be valid as long as enough people believe it is valid.
