# Freedom
Freedom may bot be what one is seeking.

Suffering is optional.

You want to be mentally free of suffering. Things falling apart around you shouldn’t effect your state of mind.

If things fail, you should realize that it’s not you who failed. It’s the system/process you set that failed.

Tell the truth.

Information frees you up.

You want to be free so that you are not doing things that you hate. Instead do things that you love

Discipline is the path to freedom. 

Freedom from Laziness, Random Motivation, etc 

Free from not checking your phone all day or not doing stupid things just to get through.
