## Why this book?

I read Deep Work after I first joined work. I hoped it would make me better at work and it did. It was the first book I read volentarily.

A TLDR of the book is: Cultivate Empty Space

## The book

Deep Work is working without distractions. This allows you to be focused on the task at hand.

You cannot be in state of Deep Work all day.

Deep Work is a skill that you need to develop daily. If you don't work towards it, you'll lose it.

Deep Work is valuable because it leads to higher productivity in less time. There are less people doing it. So if you do it, you have an advantage.

Deep Work is more meaningful.

Busy Work is not Productivity.
