Liars can wrap you and your worldview to get what they want. They often go unnoticed. They are like successful social black-hat hackers. You need good security to protect yourself.

{% include note.html content="There is a difference between not knowing the truth (being naive) and lying. Here we are talking about deception." %}

You need zero trust. Zero trust has three ideas.

{% include info.html content="Zero Trust is a concept in computer security used to protect distributed systems in cloud infrastructure. We can apply the same concepts to regular life." %}

- **Verify Explicitly**: Have explicit systems to examine if what is spoken is true. Pull out your logical fallacies and cognitive bias lists.
- **Least Privilage**: You don't have to say everything to everyone. Only give people as much access as they need. They don't need everything. They don't need your whole self. Your family needs your whole self, not others. You need to be assertive.
- **Assume Breach**: Assume the person you are talking to tends to lie. Or does not speak truthfully as diligently as you do.

**Catching a liar**:

Lies are oversimplistic and tend to change over time.

- The liar has to keep a narrative of many things that aren't true.
- When pressed, they may try to blame something else or bring up an irrelevant topic to distract us or place a straw man.
- They won't be specific.
- They may twist their words slightly to fit their lie into truth. At such moments, note if they have motivated reasoning.

Should you confront a liar? Depends on how serious the lie was?

{% include tip.html content="Stay away from people who explicitly lie or have manipulative behavior." %}

**Gain perspectives**:

If you have good social connections and a broader worldview, you'll eventually know many common lies that others face.

Books like 48 Laws of Power and The Law of Human Nature are also helpful here.

Consider both sides of the coin. And recognize that if something is too good to be true. It probably is.

**Know the common areas where you can easily be lied**:

Recognize the common areas in which you are suggestible. These likely include things you are insecure about.

One who is fat and wants to lose weight is more likely to believe in an ad about a magic pill or device.

If you are desperate about something, it's easier to believe a lie in that domain.

Most things on social media are also lying. Why would you wanna stay on a platform that's fake?
