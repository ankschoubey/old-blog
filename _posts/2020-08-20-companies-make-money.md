I often argue on the point of companies should providing value.

But on one level, maybe one of the most important level all companies are their to make money.

Providing value is often never well defined and their can be many ways to look at it.

Even employees working in a company getting a steady paycheck, raising a family, having health insurance for themselves and their family is a valuable thing.

Not every company is in an industry, geographic location or stage of growth where they can be good at everything.

The most painful part is when company drops itâ€™s employees. It usually does not happen because the company is evil. But because dropping employees is lesser evil.

Either you drop employees (and resources) or let the whole boat sink.

Big world events like Pandemic or recession always remind us how important and valuable money is for companies and for individuals.
