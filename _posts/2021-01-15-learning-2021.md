Most of these don't need to be as big. Most are weekend things.

## Code
Every time I hear TechLead, I am reminded of how bad I code and how I can get better.

These things that I need to learn to be more productive while coding

1. Making Design Document
2. Prototyping
3. Software Estimation
4. DevOps

## Revise Pytorch and get in line with Deep Learning.

Maybe a book on the topic would be useful.

1. Re-enforcement learning.

## Mathematics

Getting through Khan Academy might be a better way to go about it.

I am also thinking of choosing a field I want to learn that requires good amount of mathematics.

Something like physics or finance can be a good vehicle to learn Maths.
