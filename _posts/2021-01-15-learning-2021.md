## Code

Every time I hear TechLead, I am reminded of how bad I code and how I can get better.

These things that I need to learn to be more productive while coding

### Making Design Document
### Prototyping
### Software Estimation
### DevOps

## Revise Pytorch and get in line with Deep Learning.
### Re-enforcement learning.

## Mathematics

Getting through Khan Academy might be a better way to go about it.

I am also thinking of choosing a field I want to learn that requires good amount of mathematics.

Something like physics or finance can be a good vehicle to learn Maths.
