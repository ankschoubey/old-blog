Japan 🇯🇵 was closed to the world for most of history.

They had history of Samurai and the real encounter they had with outsider was during Mongol invasion.

They always were and thought of themself as militarily strong.

But in the modern age they suddenly realized that they were on side of the prey not predators.

They feared becoming colonized from westerners.

The possibility was very real and they realized they needed to upgrade and upgrade fast.

In the 10 years that followed, they sent there scholars to all around the world and gathered information about everything good they could find about world.

Things like education, military, etc and then added their own Japanese twist to it.

There were many mis steps along the way but in 10 years.

They went from a culture of swords ⚔️ man to a modern one and were never colonized.

There are a few lessons that I can be taken from this over simplitic snippet. These can be seen as applying to business and life in general.
- Always upgrade ourself to deal current and future problems
- Be flexible enough
- Learn by observining others
- Drop your ego. Move on with times.

The history cannot be put in such simple terms. There were a lot of mis steps with their way and the way the world was in general. I’ll recommended listening to Hardcore History

> History is not made up of fearful men.
