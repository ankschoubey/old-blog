Baton Road [^2] is a feeling I had since childhood about how humanity progresses.

No one individual changes the world. There is a generation of them. Making improvements big or small that effect and push all everyone else.

1. Someone made electricity
2. Other person did maths
3. Some person made transistor
4. Other made Integrated Circuit
5. People started making better software
6. Hardware got faster
7. Internet happened
8. Smartphone's happened
9. Deep Learning is happening

The baton has been passed from generation to generation of thinkers who were no more smarter than we are. [^3]

Though the baton is not held by an individual, it is held by a whole group of people, in my view the current major baton holder is Mr. Musk.

Mr. Musk is pushing a lot of critical areas forward. Our generation and the future once will not have to worry about a lot of problems because they will be already be solved by people like him.

Every moment happens once. [^1]
- The next Steve Jobs won't start hardware business.
- Next Zuckerberg won't start a social network.
- The next Elon Musk won't start an electric car company. The next one will have to deal with a new problem most relevant to that time.

Someday the baton will pass on to our generation. Hopefully I'll be ready.
