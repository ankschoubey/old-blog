title: Thoughts on Reading Documentation
---

Reading documentation is the best way to learn a particular technology.

A well written documentation is similar to a book and reading it has a similar effect. 

Documentation presents the original developer's philosophy behind the technology.

Depth of knowledge you gain with documentation can potentially remove hundred of hours of un-neccesary Stackoverflow searches. 

It's a difference between knowing something syntactially and knowing the philosophy behind a technology.

Most documentations are about 2-5 hours of reading Max.

I find having a highlighter extension in Chrome to be extremely useful.

Apart from the usual, the appendix sections contains many gems like FAQs and common references which make things easier. 

It the long run, it less time to read documentation end to end than to go through hours of stack overflow.
