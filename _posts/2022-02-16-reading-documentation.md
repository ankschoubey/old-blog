Reading documentation is the best way to learn a particular technology.

Well-written documentation is similar to a book and reading it has a similar effect. 

Documentation presents the original developer's philosophy behind the technology.

The depth of knowledge you gain with documentation can potentially remove hundred of hours of unnecessary Stackoverflow searches. 

It's a difference between knowing something syntactically and knowing the philosophy behind a technology.

Most documentation is about 2-5 hours of reading Max.

I find having a **highlighter extension** in Chrome to be extremely useful.

Apart from the usual, the **appendix sections** contain many gems like FAQs and standard references, making things easier. 

If you aren't able to read the complete documentation, **glance through the index**. If the documentation is good, you'll find something in the index.

In the long run, it takes less time to read documentation than to go through hours of stack overflow.
