I have been gathering a lot of points recently.

Revenue is not profit. Be profitable to be ethical long term.

All top companies create monopoly. [^8]

Don't be anti-competitive like Amazon. Competition is the long term is good for innovation.

Ethical capitalism is a game you need to win if you want good leverage.

Be the kind of business whose customer want you to successeed. [^1]

Take care of employees. Employees are assets. Treat them as such. 

If your business isn't neccessary. Pivot and move to something else.

Protect customer data by providing 100% encryption. Even you should not be able to read it.

Treat your customers and employees the way you want to be treated.

If you let your employees have a good life and good health, they'll return you back 1000x more.

If you let your customers have a good life and good health, they'll return you back 1000x more.

Princple-Agent Problem:
- The Principle wants agents to act liek the principle
- The agent who do act like principle get rewarded
