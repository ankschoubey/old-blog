## Why?

##### **Because Getting Started is:**

- Easy

- Less intimidating

- Less chance of getting stuck

## How we will do it?

##### **By:**

- focusing on the process rather than just getting the output.

- starting with easier problems.

## Prerequisite

- PyTorch:[ A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html), [Writing Custom Datasets](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html?highlight=dataset)

## Expectations from this series

**Time**: 5â€“6 Hours per challenge or more.

**Coding Style**:[ fastai coding style](https://docs.fast.ai/dev/style.html)

- While coding, no function takes 10 seconds.

- Heavy use of %timeit%

**Explanation Style**: Based on Kaggle Notebook Commits

- _Notebook Commit 1_: Will focus on getting input and output

- _Next N-1 Commits_: Will add new features/improvements. These will be linked.

- _Last Commit_: Complete solution

This way one can see get a peek behind the finished product.
