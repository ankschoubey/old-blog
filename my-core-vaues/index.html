<p>In a <a href="/core-values">previous blog post</a>, I tried to explain why defining your core values is essential. These are some of my core values. I have modified these multiple times.</p>

<p>I want things to be as “sorted” in the long term as possible without being super involved. I do not compromise on my values and try to actively practice them everyday. They are my best bet.</p>

<p>Each and every opportunity to practice these values aren’t just options, it’s two different pathways. Things fall apart when I don’t act virtously. The way I/someone pays for their privilages is virtues.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Responsibility</li>
  <li>Nirwana/Peace</li>
  <li>Telling the Truth and being hyper-realistic.</li>
  <li>Systems Thinking</li>
  <li>Inputs Matter</li>
  <li>Time Matter</li>
  <li>Courage is calling</li>
  <li>Team Work</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-this-post-is-structured">How this post is structured?</h2>

<p>In each of the value I try to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Explain the goal of having the value</li>
  <li>Some 80/20 rules that surround the value</li>
  <li>Systems that can make forming habit around the value second nature.</li>
  <li>Resources, Books and Role Models</li>
  <li>Examples that help solidify</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="responsibility-its-not-worth-having-ego-but-no-one-will-save-you"><strong>Responsibility</strong>: It’s not worth having ego but no one will save you.</h2>

<p>Responsibility provides meaning. By taking on responsibilities voluntarily and facing your fears, you’ll avoid being nihilistic.</p>

<p>So, pick the heaviest weight you can take and push it towards the best aim you can find. Then at least you can know, “Dumb as I am, I can at least push a thing from point A to point B” <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Taking on responsibility voluntarily/facing the heaviest fear you can face is how you’ll have your life sorted.</p>

<h2 id="nirwanapeace-dont-suffer-imagined-troubles"><strong>Nirwana/Peace</strong>: Don’t suffer imagined troubles</h2>

<p>Being unhappy is inefficient.</p>

<p>Happiness/Peace is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. You can choose to live a certain way that will lead to peace.</p>

<p>To have peace, your brain should be in controll in every situation. You have to be mentally tough.</p>

<p>You need to be peaceful if you want things to be good long term. Develop detachment (not wanting), be less judgemental and optimism. Aiming for peace requires a lot of recognizing, rethinking and flipping/unlearing almost everything.</p>

<p>If you don’t believe that you can achieve ultimate peace (Nirwana), you’ll have a hard time finding it.</p>

<p><strong>Role Models</strong>:  Naval Ravikant, Sam Harris, Kapil Gupta, Sadhguru</p>

<h2 id="truth-unhide-the-fog-by-becoming-truth-seeking-missile"><strong>Truth</strong>: Unhide the fog by becoming truth seeking missile.</h2>

<p>Humans aren’t rational creatures because we cannot understand or have information about everything at once.</p>

<p>Since we base our decisions on our perceived reality, it is very important to our perceived reality match original reality.</p>

<p>There are a few sub paths within the relm of truth:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Seeking truth</li>
  <li>Accepting truth</li>
  <li>Always saying truth</li>
  <li>Always activing truthfully.</li>
</ol>

<p>Truth can feel random. But we can create a habit/series of step to follow to ensure we are as truthful as possible.</p>

<p>Truthful speech has following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before telling the truth to others. Let go of your identity. Deliver truth to yourself completely. This can be something you don’t want but you know it exactly.</li>
  <li>Be as specific as possible. Being wage means you aren’t speaking the truth.</li>
  <li>Test out the truth quickly. Truths are not based on assumptions. Depending on the context either the truth will be a past event, in which can you could recall the past event exactly. Or a feeling, in which case one has to really listen to himself.</li>
  <li>Accept the truth and let go. Don’t over rationalize after one point.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only way is to let go of the outcome and to assume that whatever happens in truth is the best thing that can happen.</p>

<p>While dealing with people, you have to ask people multiple times to make sure they tell you everything because often humans tell white lies to not hurt your feelings.</p>

<p><strong>Role Models</strong>: Naval Ravikant, Sam Harris, Jordan Peterson, Kapil Gupta, Mark Manson
<strong>Books</strong>: Lying by Sam Harriss, 12 Rules for Life by Jordan B Peterson, <strong>48 Laws of Power</strong> (You don’t have to follow it. You just have to read it.)</p>

<h2 id="systems-thinking-become-an-effortness-executioner---everthing-is-undercontrol"><strong>Systems Thinking</strong>: Become an effortness executioner - ‘Everthing is undercontrol’</h2>

<p>Aims are good for setting up initial direction. But systems/processes are how you work towards them and beyond them.</p>

<p>Systems allow you to free up your mental RAM. Systems break problems down. They assure that as long as the systems are working right, the direction is right.</p>

<p>Systems can include by are not limited to: trained habits, routines, frameworks, automation, etc.</p>

<p>The goal with systems is to keep them up most of the time. Perfect streak may not be possible unless human component is removed.</p>

<p>Most important systems are habits because they impact our day to day. These are most impactful systems one can have.</p>

<h2 id="inputs-matter-catelist"><strong>Inputs Matter</strong>: Catelist</h2>

<p>Our role in the world is essentially to interact with it. All other virtues except peace, are related to output. Doing things that impact the world. Peace is completely internal. Input matters is the interface between external and internal.</p>

<p>We have limited time and limited attention. Like any resource, resource allocation can either help us get better returns or lower our return. The quality and ability to process inputs determines quality of outputs.</p>

<p>Over the long term, you want “inputs” in your life to push yourself in the desired direction. The quality and quantity of inputs needed very dependent on stage of progress and incoming of opportunities.</p>

<p>Majorly our inputs include:
People you spend most time with. -&gt; Covered in Responsibility and Team Work</p>
<ul>
  <li>future sections on choosing the right people would be relevant here.
Things in your environment. -&gt; Covered in Systems
Content you most consume.  -&gt; Would be covered below. But you’ll find the principles can apply to other areas as well.</li>
  <li>learning</li>
  <li>entertainment</li>
</ul>

<p>The quantity of inputs: determines how much demand there is. How much needs to be done.
The quality of inputs: determines how important the input it.</p>

<p>Quantity of inputs:</p>

<p>If you don’t prioritise, everything will seem important. You work on everything important at once, your ROI will diminish significantly. It’s ideal to work on a few problems at a time. Get it done and solidified and move into other problem. Early sense of progress that comes multitasking if false. Because multitasking is screwing everything up at once.  WIP Limits is a well established technique that would help limit multitasking and context switching.</p>

<p>Quality of Inputs
Compounding is attending a few high quality inputs. 80/20 rule is very applicable to every value. Most things come from small inputs.</p>

<p>By <strong>rejecting</strong> most inputs that don’t make sense at the moment, one does not loose anything. Rather the small rejection helps free time and attention to focus on what matters.</p>

<p>It’s worth having a system to quickly accept and reject inputs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quantity of inputs: If it’s too much you’ll not gain much from it. Feeds of any kind, like facebooks newsfeed, instagrams feed, youtube subscription suggestion, continuously news, etc all assume that what’s latest “data” is the most important. This data is rarely <strong>information</strong>. Reliable information is what does not change overtime. Therefore best sources are usually not what has come out right now. Also, news/updates of anykind aren’t easily transferable. Principles that stay true for longer are better than latest techniques.</li>
  <li>Quality of inputs: Inputs should be a credible source. Non-latest Books are highest form of credible source because it goes through a lot of processing before being published. Similarly for programming, documentation (not stack overflow) is a highest credible source. Though these are credible source, one may be required to get context around the book before reading. For such cases, I find taking to someone/internet resources to be better. What’s scarce is usually higher quality.</li>
  <li>Available attention: Reject if you are occupled, WIP limit.</li>
  <li>Explore vs Exploit: Switch between explore and exploit. Reduce your inputs during exploit. Have truly random inputs during explore. But for a short duration only.</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing Inputs</p>

<p>The first step to managing inputs is to track it. We can only optimise and process what we know exactly.</p>

<p>It makes sense to use some sort of a system for keeping track of inputs (at-least content consumed) and over time looking at how they are impacted. My system initially was the manual table below. Now I have moved this tracker to <a href="https://www.notion.so/">notion database</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have rejected inputs, have inputs tracked and prioritised it’s time to work on them the best way possible.</p>

<p>Most entertainment aren’t something that need heavy processing and there isn’t a need for gaining something out of them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ideal if entertainment is a social event.</li>
</ul>

<p>For learning, the goal is usually to gain something out.</p>

<p>To gain the most out of learning</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be distraction free while learning.</li>
  <li>Work on small number of learning projects at a time.</li>
  <li>Choose resource wisely: Material beats the method. You can choose a material that is easier, fun and interactive to consume.</li>
</ul>

<p>reduce feedback time: test, talk, teach as soon as possible</p>

<h2 id="time-matters-you-dont-have-forever"><strong>Time Matters</strong>: You don’t have forever</h2>

<p>Time is the most precious finite resource we have. We should make good use of it. If we do, we make time our ally.</p>

<p>Like any resource, one can think of time in numeric terms. This allows us to categorize activities as assets which add back time or liabilities, which take time away. Our goal essentially then is to create more time-assets with high time-ROI.</p>

<p>80% of more of our activities during a given day is not new. They are merely habits that have been repeated.</p>

<p>So essentially, by carefully observing, choosing and forming our habits would lead to more <strong>time-assets</strong> and less <strong>time-liabilities</strong>. Usually, time-assets and time-liabilities are opposites of each other.</p>

<p>Most time-liabilities snap our attention and lead us to caring about wrong things. Therefore, time-assets help us course correct. Therefore, time management is essentially attention management.</p>

<p>Some of the most impactful time-aseets and liabilities are:</p>

      <th>Time-Assets</th>
      <th>Time Liabilities</th>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Planning</strong>: Even a little bit of planning, something like 10 minutes alone creating a written plan could save hours, days or even years. <br /><br />Planning allows course correction. Ideally, don’t start working without a plan.</td>
      <td><strong>Rushing</strong>: Though it may seem you are making progress. The probability is higher that you are moving in the wrong direction. It’s better to fix a plan</td>

      <td><strong>5 Min Rule</strong>: Don’t allow yourself to be down or procrastinate for more than 5 minutes. <br /><br />During such time ask yourself: Is this worth the return on my time?<br /><br />Remember you can’t live forever.</td>
      <td>Forever Rule: <strong>The opposite of 5 min rule</strong>: Letting fear/laziness/indecision stop you.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>WIP Limit</strong>: Focus on a few things and complete them. If your WIP limit is reached, don’t add work on newer tasks unless older ones are complete.</td>
      <td><strong>Trying to change people</strong>: You cannot change people. You can suggest but cannot force. Leading by example. It’s the best option you have.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Pomodoro</strong>: Working in Pomodoros keeps you focused. If you can’t work with pomodoro, you haven’t planned carefully enough.<br /><br />To have pomodoro sessions.<br />1.

<p>During normal decision making, one can calculate ROI of their actions: think about how much time you’ll invest and how much return you’ll get back.</p>

<p><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>This is probably the most important value that supports all others. It takes courage to tell the truth, act responsibly, detach yourself to be peaceful, build and trusting long term systems, and break the spell of wasting time. And the courage of following the plan and push yourself when time comes.</p>

<p>Everything worth while is an act of courage.</p>

<p>No one is invincible. It’s good and courageous to be vulnerable. To admit to faults and take steps to improve it but it’s not okay to be weak.</p>

<p>Courage is exciting. It pushes to act beyond what one believes is possible. So get excited by the challenge and push yourself beyond what you think is possible.</p>

<p>Humans are a social animal. We are node in a network<sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The way we act and interact in the network determines the life of everyone.</p>

<p>We stand on the shoulders of all those who came before us. And we are building a foundation for all those who will come after.</p>

<p>Plus who are we doing all this “core-values” for if we can’t even help and be there people around us. One cannot do it alone and it is worthless doing it alone.</p>

<p>There are multiple levels of “team work” and each requires a different approach.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Everyone else</li>
  <li>Close Friends</li>
  <li>Family and Partner</li>
  <li>Children</li>
</ul>

<p>This also requires a level of self awareness and knowing how your interaction/quality of relationships can be improved.</p>

<p>One can be strict with himself but has to be patient with others. And remember that you are probably not right so listen to people carefully -&gt; Openness.</p>
