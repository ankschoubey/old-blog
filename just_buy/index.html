This is the anti-Derek Sivers approach.</p>

<p>If a product already exists, don‚Äôt build it yourself from scratch.</p>

<p>I got excited by Rasberry Pi and Arduino boards a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>I bought them all and built:</p>
<ul>
  <li>‚ÄúSmart‚Äù switchboard which I can control from my phone.</li>
  <li>A retro raspberry pi gaming setup with an old ps3 controller.</li>
</ul>

<p>Building them was a little bit of work. I had to watch a lot of videos and google a lot of things.</p>

<p>I connected Alexa so now I could control lights and fans with just my voice.</p>

<p>Sometimes the problem was just wired and I had the replace them.</p>

<p>It took a month for each but after building it I thought it was done. Complete finally.</p>

<p>Then a few weeks passed. Switch stopped working. The gaming console thing was decent but it stopped working too.</p>

<p>Both took a week each to fix. Finally, now it is complete.</p>

<p>A week later it broke again. Then again after a week.</p>

<p>This was especially inconvenient because my family was using the switch too.</p>

<p>Now raspberry is just lying in storage and one smart switch which family used was removed.</p>

<p>I still had the switch in my room. I just had to fix it. It‚Äôs been 2 years. üòÇ It is still there. And now I don‚Äôt want to fix it. So I am going to finally remove it from my wall.</p>

<p>Why spent time building it yourself when you just purchase it. Especially hardware shit.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt try to develop using plain javascript when Angular or React can do better.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt try to build a gaming computer from scratch when you can just buy a console and be done with it.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt try to ‚Äúuse Linux‚Äù where you‚Äôll have to spend a lot of time setting everything perfectly.</p>

<p>Of course, some people do it. But I would argue to only do it if it is your full-time job. Or it is something you have to and want to learn.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt waste your time on problems that have already been solved.</p>
