Making improvements big or small that effect and push everyone forward. . Someone made electricity | Other person did maths | Some person made transistor | Other made Integrated Circuit | People started making better software | Hardware got faster | Internet happened | Smartphone’s happened | Deep Learning is happening | The baton has been passed from generation to generation of thinkers who were no smarter than we are. 2 . Though the baton is not held by an individual, it is held by a whole group of people, in my view, the current major baton holder is Mr. Musk. . Mr. Musk is pushing a lot of critical areas forward. Our generation and the future once will not have to worry about a lot of problems because they will be already be solved by people like him. . Every moment happens once. 3 . The next Steve Jobs won’t start a hardware business. | Next Zuckerberg won’t start a social network. | Next Elon Musk won’t start an electric car company. | The next one will have to deal with a new problem most relevant to that time. | . Someday the 🔥 baton will pass on to our generation. Hopefully I’ll be ready. . Footnotes .

            "content": ". Note: I am not a psychologist. So the upcoming piece is quite unscientific. Action: Hobbies . Hobbies are weird in the sense that after an initial interest in doing it we start expecting too much from it. . Each next creation becomes a race to be better than the previous one. . Every-time you show something you cooked or something you made… the first reaction from people is… why don’t you open a business?? . No! This is something I do for fun… . There is no real ROI! I don’t want to be famous or make money with this. . Life requires activities that have no other purpose than the joy that activities itself provides.1 . If suddenly there is an expected ROI attached it has a probability of not being fun anymore. Though the result of having an expected ROI to a hobby is that the quality and quantity of output increase a lot. . Hobbies are an active process: The more effort that has been put in the higher is the reward. 1 . Consumption: Books, Media, and Games . One of the things that many consider being a waste of time is consumption. Often quotes float around which says something on the lines of Make your own life so exciting that you don’t need to consume anything else. . On one level this may be true but it is a little too extreme. . Is watching Silicon Valley a waste of time? Maybe. | Did I get a boost of coding confidence ever since starting Silicon Valley? Hell yeah! ROI was higher. . | Was watching One Piece a waste of time? No. I actually enjoyed it. | Did I get my positivity pumped? Definitely. | . Most consumption only impacts the mindset of the consumer and does not result in direct action. The tricky thing is that we don’t know what will get us inspired or changed perspective for the better. If we did knew it already, it would be pretty boring. . Consumption is a passive process: You don’t have to actively work at it. . People . I actually don’t know how to write this without giving my personal anecdotes. So if you are a programmer explore this section in the DOM 😬. . I have been guilty of setting very high standards for people around me and for my behavior towards them too. It is not something I do consciously nor it is something I want to do. The people around me have always been supportive, caring and made me less bored. We are not dealing with creatures of logic. These are people just like me with emotions, ups/downs, discomforts, strengths, and weaknesses. We are social animals made to support each other during the bad and the good. I was and am always available for my friends/family when a problem arose in their life and they need me. But I was never there to share happy moments with them too. Dealing with people is both active and passive: Active: To be there to be for them when a problem arose and they need. Passive: To be there to share their happiness. And since you are someone who took the effort to read this in DOM, I am really grateful. If we have, in some way lost touch just ping :) . There is more to life than increasing its speed. 2 . .

I understand that there are more things in the world then technology products but for a lot of technology products I don’t like ads. . Like cars. Tesla does it the best. . They make a really really good product which is much better that what is offered by the competition and thus the words spreads by word of mouth. . As the industry will mature I can understand that the gap between your product and the competition is very less. Thus in that state to win the market you essentially have to try everything like Advertisements. . Marketing money . Ever heard of Beats by Dr. Dre. The product kind of sucked before they got bought off by Apple. . Their product money split was something like this: . 40 percent marketing + beautiful cover 60 percent product . The reason for their survival was not that they had a good product. Bose was probably better in every way. . The only reason for their survival was every god damn music video used Beats in their video. Their packaging was too good. . On the other hand Bose was profitable just for their product. . Beats is not at the place it was in it’s hype years now. That is likely because Apple (it’s now parent company) has decided to focus more on product quality. .

Along with these were concepts such as Algorithms and Data Structures. All these in effort to make original programs. . What we do . Increasingly I have realized that most of what we do is not creating functionality from scratch. . These are the kind of things I do regularly: . Wanted to add zoom in zoom out on images: OpenSeaDragon module | Wanted to generate PDF on the client-side: jsPDF module | Wanted trailer videos: TheMovieDB API | Idle session timeout alert: ng-idle | Want to talk to a DB: Spring Data JPA | Wanna have a table on a page: I don’t write my HTML tables. I use DevExpress. | Want my website to be installable on Mobile/Desktop: @angular/pwa module | . Programming role for the most part is to configure other’s code/modules/APIs so that it works well along with other modules and our tiny code. . And whatever tiny code that we do write is rarely even unique. For the most part, it is either the same functionality as something built before or copy/pasted from StackOverflow or Github. . Also for a good amount of things, one can easily skip backend coding by using something like Firebase. . Code Generators and Configuration Files . I wanted to contribute to PyTorch so I read their code and understood nothing. . I thought I had enough Python &amp; DL skills but that was not the problem. . The point was they have ATEN: a kind of configuration language that allows them to generate programs in their target language on the Fly. . A topic similar to code generators are configuration files such a .properties or .yaml . I love these. The behavior of the application can be changed entirely using configuration files. For these to be most effective the entire application has to be built with configurability in mind. . 80/20 split . I used to despise DevOps earlier because I never wanted to leave programming behind. After all, a major part of DevOps is configuring tools. But I realize now that ROI is huge. . I still believe that learning the principles are more important than learning a specific technology. . Learning a principle such as Deep Learning means that underlying technological tools such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, or even AutoML matter very little. . These principles (20%) apply to a small by very important parts (80%): . deciding what to do | connecting different modules | debugging | .",

Commit Version 3: Improvements . Changes: Proper Accuracy, Graph, and Data Normalization . Day 4 . | Score — 0.96 . | Time invested — about an hour . | . Proper Accuracy . Accuracy should always be calculated on the validation set. . Creating a separate validation set . val_len = int(len(ds)*0.01) # 0.01 percent of data train_len = len(ds) — val_len # all other are in training from torch.utils.data import random_split train_ds, val_ds = random_split(ds, [train_len, val_len]) . Likewise, 2 data loaders are created. . bs = 64 train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, bs) val_dl = DataLoader(val_ds, bs) . Changes in the training loop . A separate list called accuracies in created to store the accuracy of an epoch. . ... with torch.no_grad(): accuracy = 0 for images, labels in val_dl: out = net(images.float()) accuracy+=(out.argmax(dim=1) == labels).sum().item() accuracies.append(accuracy/len(val_ds) * 100) . Graph . Since the accuracy of each epoch was stored in a separate accuracies list, creating a graph was easy. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot(range(epochs), accuracies) . Data Normalization . After plotting the graph, I realized accuracy was 43% which is the same as the score of commit 2. . The easiest thing to do was to normalize the data. . Since MNIST images are in the range of 1…250 the easiest thing to do was to divide by 250 which would result in a range of 0…1. . Ideally, the range should be around 0 so an even better approach would be . image = image/250–0.5 . this would result in a range between -0.5…+0.5. . Later we would use torchvision.transforms.Normalize(mean, std, inplace=False) which generates unique normalization value for each dataset . Commit 6: ConvNet, and GPU . Day 6 . | Score — 0.97 . | Time invested — about 2 hours (lots of googling and reading docs) + 1 hours fixes bugs . | . ConvNet . Convolutional Neural Networks are ideal images. . ResNet . ResNet 34 is my goto ConvNet but since MNIST is so easy, I went with ResNet 18. . import torchvision.models as models resnet18 = models.resnet18(pretrained=True) resnet18.fc #print fully connected network . ResNet is designed to output 1000 classes. But our output is from 0…9 aka 10 classes. . lin_in = resnet18.fc.in_features import torch.nn as nn resnet18.fc = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(lin_in, 10), nn.Softmax(dim=1) ) . Convert Grayscale to RGB image . ResNet expects RGB images. MNIST is grayscale. . img = img.view(3, 28, 28).expand(3, 28, 28)` . This grayscale to the RGB line is added to our Dataset class. . Normalization . When using an existing model, we need to use the same normalization values as that model. The docs mention the normalization value. . import torchvision.transforms as transforms normalize = transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) . The init and getitem dataset class have been modified to use this transformation. . Modifications have also been made to test_ds. . GPU . One I started the training loop, I realized it suddenly became too slow. . GPU is needed! . device = torch.device(&#39;cuda:0&#39;) if torch.cuda.is_available() else &#39;cpu&#39; . If the GPU is on, the device will be cuda. . The neural network and the data in training, validation and texting loop have been changed to run on GPU. . net = net.to(device) ... images, labels = images.to(device,dtype=torch.float), labels.to(device) . And since we are on GPU we can increase our batch size from 64 to much higher. . I experimented with a few sizes from 320…640 and kept an eye on GPU utilization and settled for 512. . . I did the same for num_worker which specifies the number of threads to load a batch. This is CPU stuff. . Along with monitoring GPU and CPU usage, I modified training_loop to show the amount of time taken to complete each epoch. . bs = 512 num_workers = 2 train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, bs, num_workers=num_workers) val_dl = DataLoader(val_ds, bs, num_workers=num_workers) . This resulted in 7 seconds per epoch. . For testing, the batch_size can be much higher since we don’t have to back prop. . Commit 7: Improvement . Day 8 . | Score — 0.97 . | Time invested — about 30 minutes . | . I learned that you don’t need nn.Softmax if you are using nn.CrossEntropyLoss. . nn.CrossEntropyLoss has nn.Softmax built-in and the results of softmax are not used during back-prop. So it can be safely removed. . Now FC is this: . lin_in = resnet18.fc.in_features import torch.nn as nn resnet18.fc = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(lin_in, 10) ) . .

It is possible to prepare and align AngularJS applications with Angular even before beginning the upgrade process. These preparation steps are all about making the code more decoupled, more maintainable, and better aligned with modern development tools.

Leave clues that will allow you to rebuild the semantic model when you come back at a later time. . Source: Why your code is so hard to understand . Comments . Comments can lie. The code does not. . Ideally, your code should be so good that you do not require comments. . This might not be true in one case which is when you code something weird and required domain-specific explanation. . Like in Machine Learning, a choice of certain parameters or a certain step can be understood better by putting the link to explanation/research paper in the comment. While reading just the code, it might not be obvious for the reader to understand what to make of it. (Source: Jeremy Howard fast.ai). . Intent giving names . Use pronounceable names . Variables should be named so that they make it clear what it contains. . Variable names should always be easy-to-read, be short yet meaningful, mixed case with a lower-case first letter English words. . b)Use plural names for arrays/collections of objects. . c) Constant (static final) variable names should be in all capital letters and separate words in the name with the underscore, i.e., PRIORITY_NORMAL, .

This is kind of an exception to the above rule: for things that are very very common, short forms are better. (You also type less). . Just don’t short everything to be a single letter. Be small but descriptive. . Also, having a list of abbreviations used in your project readme/documentation can be helpful. . Examples, . repo for repository . | util for utility. . | serv for service . | len for length . | dto for Data Transfer Object (pretty common) . | . Make sure you use the same abbreviations everywhere in your code aka one word per concept in all classes. . (Below examples are for method names) . get/fetch/find . | set/update . | . In case you are trying machine learning, I guess this article is much better suited: Jeremy’s notes on fastai coding style . Magic numbers and strings . Any number or string in your code that isn’t immediately obvious to someone with very little knowledge. . Source: StackOverflow . Better to declare them in a separate constants file. . Constants should be snake_case and CAPITAL. . . In the case of Java, enums can also be used to achieve something similar but they will contain a lot of java boilerplate. . . There are also language-specific naming conventions involved like: . Java and Typescript prefer camelCase . | Python and SQL prefer snake_case . | For Unit test cases . My aim is not so much about reducing the lines of code. Tests are usually small. (In case if your tests are huge and complex then you must have written a bad code) . I prefer to keep the end of each method the same. Like: . . I use Mockito so I skip the first line. The start of the function then is with all stub actions. . The last 3 lines are usually similar. . A variable expected: expected value . | A variable actual: calls the function/method . | assertion . | I find that for most tasks it is easier to make changes to expected and actual variables rather than put everything into assertions. The assertion is always clean. . An alternative to the above assertion is to write like below which I find to be messy. . . Previous: Flat is better than nested .

It becomes hard to find where a particular block ends easily (especially if someone writes 8 or more nests 😖) . Unnecessary horizontal scrolling . Also, you might have to scroll horizontally to see what the complete code is since it does not fit your screen. . Nesting makes your code hard to understand. . While you are reading your nested block, you have to remember what all conditions preceded it. . The below guideline should counter that: . Max indent should be 2, in case of exceptions 3 . Avoid the use of else. . Return/throw when not okay . By returning early you make sure that in each of your functions the last line of your function returns what it is actually supposed to return. This will make your code consistent. . | Also, you would find that you avoid unnecessary nesting (which will calm your eyes 👁 and your linter). Thus, making your code easy to understand. . | . . Bubble vs Gateway . Bad (left): Bubble-Style . Good (right): Gateway-Style . If deep nests exist? Separate loop and operation . Extract the logic to other readable methods or use streams (Java)/lambda or something equivalent in your programming language of choice. . Usually, there is a problem where you have to perform a bunch of operations on an array of objects. . I tend to create at-least** 2 functions** for this: . One that performs an operation on a single object. . | Other calls the first function in a loop. . | In case if something goes wrong, it is easier to debug it since I know what function has what responsibility. . Simplified Example: Link to Code . . You have a bunch of students for which you calculate the average grade. . . In the above BadGrader, you can see than the code of calculating the grades is within the loop. This is bad as we cannot use the same piece of code elsewhere in the program. . . The BetterGrader separates the calculation part from the printing part. . . GoodGrader removes the naive logic that was used to calculate average and replaces it with a much shorter code that makes use of inbuilt functions. .

The contest was a month ago from this writing. I had the time to really sit and figure out what went well and what didn’t. . Approach . Here was my approach which I did in stages: . Step 1: Make models . 1. Make a simple resnet50 model. And make sure input and output submission file are correct. . 2. Improve the model. I found that the images were black and old. But the number of images were less and we cannot use external data so my solution was. . Heavy data augmentation (warping, crops, rotations): lead to 5–7 percent increase in F1 score and accuracy. . | Progressive increase image size. . | I initially started with (50,70) images . | Trained it that then increased it. Trained it again. . | . 3. Training approach. . Freeze the model train for 4 epochs | Unfreeze the model train for 7 epochs | I found unfreezing was getting higher accuracy but only when done more than freeze training. 7 is what I stuck at. | I replicated the kernel and trained resnet18, resnet34, vgg16, vgg19 and densenet121 so that I can ensemble there outputs | Model Making Environment: Kaggle Code at Models directory | . Step 2: Max Ensemble . After I had all the outputs from different models. . I used the output CSVs to make a max ensemble. .

Code: ankschoubey/AnalyticsVidya_Game_Of_Deep_Learning . Lessons and Mistakes Learned . Code . Environment . I trained on Kaggle Kernel. The only way to get output files was to commit. . | I also did not load existing models because on Kaggle you have to attach it as a dataset and then load.

Transfer learning without discriminative learning rate is stupid. | . Refactor code early before replicating the kernel . I replicated kernels so that I can train different models on different kernels and get results faster. . | The problem was that I had introduced a bug which got replicated. Also, making changes was a pain because I had to copy paste things multiple times. . | . Use metrics used in the contest . Kind of dumb to mention this: I did not use the F1 score.

Did forget the idea of checkpoints entirely. | . Useless Model . I made an ensemble which sucked because it only lead to 0.05 percent improvement. . | The reason was I used a lot of mediocre models. . | 1 ResNet 34/50 would have been fine. . | Also did not know about DenseNet very well back then. . | I believe that an ensemble of ResNet and DenseNet would have been wonderful. . | . Data . Look at the data and use good augmentation . I saw some images were grey scale and old. I might have got a higher score if I had taken time | . . Using good data augmentation. .
