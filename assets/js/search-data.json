WHEN block: describes the condition over a method. . SHOULD block: describes the assertion. . GIVEN/WHEN/THEN mini-blocks: helps keep tests clean . You may have noticed WHEN, SHOULD and AND are capitalized. This is by design. This helps highlight logic. . Examples . 1 - We are creating a method which inserts new value if id does not exists in database else updates existing value.class . upsert method WHEN value exists SHOULD update value | . | WHEN does not exists SHOULD insert new value | . | . | . 2 - We have a UI components which should message “No Content” if data items is not present.

Benefits . method/when/should block is perfect companion for TDD, is language agnostic and can be easily used with templating features like IntelliJ’s live template. . Having specific blocks means that test descriptions are always written a certain way. This clarifies thinking and makes sharing and understanding easier. . Blocks group tests together, making them easier to find. . Also, when tests run in IDE like IntelliJ, the output is much cleaner. The example section above is a good representation of this. .

There are several runners that come with Spring boot. . @SpringBootTest being the most general of them. Mostly this is used in combination with @DirtiesContent which will restart spring boot after every test class by default. This isn’t ideal. . Using @SpringBootTest is Integration Tests. We don’t want every test to use this. . We want to load the minimum spring-boot infrastructure as possible and still ensure accurate tests. . There are a few that can be used. . If tests are related to a DB. Use @DataMongoTest or equivalent JPA runner with @Import annotation. | If tests are related to Web/Controller. Use @WebFluxTest or equivalent Spring MVC runner. | Important: If tests require initializing a single bean. Use @ExtendWith(SpringRunner.class) with @Import to specify bean to initialize. | If @SpringBootTest is required, try to use it in combination with @Import or @ContextConfiguration to limit beans creation. | The best case: Aim for Tests which are purely java based and do not involve spring boot. This ofcourse isn’t possible for every scenario. | . Run tests in parallel (Saved 37% running time) . Create a junit-platform.properties file in test/resource/junit-platform.properties and add following minimum. 1 . junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true .

I prefer first method of using @Execution(CONCURRENT) because some of my tests weren’t designed to run in parallel. . I found data tests with @DataMongoTest by asserting over different data. .

For example, the Education budget was set at 20 billion but only 5 billion was spent. Or they overspent which ate up other areas. . Usually, these discussions assume that spending the complete budget allocated is best. . Underspending: Not doing enough | Overspending: Doing too much and eating into other areas. | . The same can be applied to resources of one’s #life. . . I believe these are the most important resources a person spends on. . Time Budget | Attention Budget | Money Budget | . So, given the premise above, the goal is to have a specific time, attention, and money budget for each important area of life and major activity. It isn’t ideal to set budgets for everything (else you won’t have an attention budget). . Time (in hours) and money (in currency) are easily quantifiable. Attention isn’t. .

This allows us to categorize activities as assets that add back time or liabilities, which take time away. Our goal then is to create more time-assets with high time-ROI. . 80% of our activities during a given day are not new. They are merely routines. . So essentially, carefully observing, choosing, and forming our habits would lead to more time-assets and less time-liabilities. Usually, time-assets and time-liabilities are opposites of each other. . Most time-liabilities snap our attention and lead us to care about wrong things. Therefore, time-assets help us course correct. Therefore, time management is closely linked to attention management. . Most time assets are generatlly slower and more stuctured which is why they are usually avoided. Time liabilities on the other hand feel easy to get started with so they are done more. So, one needs to make it easy to get started on time-assets and harder to get started on time-liabilities. . Some of the most impactful time-assets and liabilities are: . Time-Assets Time Liabilities . Planning: Even a little bit of planning, something like 10 minutes alone creating a written plan could save hours, days, or even years. Planning allows course correction. Ideally, don’t start working without a plan. | Rushing: Though it may seem you are making progress.

During such time ask yourself: Is this worth the return on my time?Remember you can’t live forever. | Forever Rule: The opposite of 5 min rule: Letting fear/laziness/indecision stop you. | . WIP Limit: Focus on a few things and complete them. If your WIP limit is exceeded, don’t add work on newer tasks unless older ones are complete. | Trying to change people: You cannot change people.

Tools like Swagger for APIs and storybook from UI components make it very easy to auto-document code in most cases. . 2. Encourage use of your own documentation . Using your own documentation would help you find and fix bugs in it. . For example, You could encourage your team to use Swagger UI instead of Post Man for testing APIs. . 3. For within the team: Have a shared wiki . Wiki helps keep everyone in sync and like the previous point, encourages updations wherever necessary. . 4. Tests are also documentation of sorts but for the internal team only. . Tests capture what the code would do.

The goal with testing is to make it as english sentence like as possible. . You want someone who has not seen codebase to read your tests and understand what your code does. In that way, testing is a documentation for your code. . Here are some strategies to achieve it. . Have Fluent Assertions . Libraries like AssertJ make it easy to write tests which sound like english . Prefix name of test classes with Unit/Inte/System . This will help limit scope of the test class to be certain types of tests . Aim for 70/20/10 split between these tests 1 . Create Test Data Generator Method or Builder . -&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH2cz1o9Vsg . Create test helper methods . Group Tests Together . You should group your tests together. This would make it easier to find your tests . Junit and Jest both allow for grouping of tests. . In JUnit 5 you can use @NestClasses | In Jest you can use describe | . Example: . JUnit: . class MainTestClass @Nested @DisplayName(&quot;Group of tests&quot;) class MethodNameTests(){ @Test @DisplayName(&quot;Test Name&quot;) class tests{ ... } } . Jest: . describe(&quot;Group of tests&quot;, ()=&gt;{ it(&quot;test name&quot;, ()=&gt;{ }) }) . Have global mocks/stub object . Your tests should be as small as possible. Rather than create objects in every test method, Create a dummy stub and use it in all subsiqueny tests . In Junit you can have @BeforeEach and @BeforeAll annotations to have methods run before each test case or test class. . Mock object . Naming . In case I am testing a positive response, I usually name variable as such. . If it is a variable which is bad, prefix it with bad . example: . idealHttpHeader | goodFuture | . If it’s a bad response, . Example: . badHttpHeader | badHttpHeaderWithoutContentType | badFuture | . Never generate random inputs. Always use fixed values. 2 . Start with method_should_&lt;&gt;_when/with_&lt;&gt;() or itShould_&lt;&gt;_When_&lt;&gt; . This makes you focus on exactly what you are testing. . Though you can remove the should part too. . Example: . GroupName: Add function | TestName: Should work with negative values: add_shouldWork_withNegativeValues | TestName: Should work with positive values: add_shouldWork_withPositiveValues | TestName: Should work with floating point values: add_shouldWork_withFloatingPoint | TestName: Should raise exception when input is null: add_shouldRaiseException_whenInputisNull | .

Start the tests which fixing the input values and mocking -&gt; Given Call the function in test -&gt; when Assert Responses -&gt; then . Size of tests should be less than size of your display . This is a useful guideline which applies to a normal clean code too. . Assertions . Best Practice: One logical assertion per test method. 3 . Have clear error messages 2 . Aim for asserting behavior and not implementation detail. More coupled your tests are with implementation, harder the refactoring would be.4 . Messages .

There are my initial thoughts on test driven development. . Why TDD? . If you are doing TDD, you do not need to setup and interact external systems before implementation.1 You can use their mocks. . Both tests and code is cleaner and precise. . The Three Laws of TDD . You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass. | You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures. | You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test. | How to TDD? . Assume the test will work properly, what is the minimum test? Write that test. | Fix compilation errors if any. 1 | Write minimum code required to pass the test. | Run all the tests | Iterate | Making TDD easier . Usually TDD can be cumbersome because: . Testing is extra code | You have to switch between current code and tests | you have to rerun tests | No one does it | Mitigrations . 1. TDD is a todo list of feature to do . By writing test first, you get clear on what you want to implement. This leads to better design. . 2. Switch between testing and code easily .

TDD leads to fast feedback . to refactor you need really good tests . seeing a test fail is a test that feature is not implemented. sometimes it may happen that the new test passes which means the feature is already implemented and you had forgotten to assert it. or your system is not working properly. . “I don’t know what I am going to build” business? -&gt; ask them for clarificaiton logic -&gt; get away from screen and plan properly side effect -&gt; read documentation. write a lot of little program. repl command line interface to test/learn libraries. jshell? . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-cyC6O81Bk . // it’s hard to decide what to test when you are writing tests later if you write tests later, you do it for what is working. .

It may be better to compare Angular with a React framework like Next.js. . There are things I like about both. . Language . Angular comes with typescript by default. Typescript is much more superior to JS. React can be used with typescript too but it’s a developer’s choice. . React is easy to get started . Especially with functional components, getting started with react is too easy. . React has too many little things to take care of. . Strength can be a weakness or one could say React isn’t a full framework. . React has too much to learn. And every project is essentially different. . Angular comes with preferred ways of doing things which I like more than base React. Angular has everything important built-in. So you’ll find every Angular project uses the same set of libraries for common tasks like rest call (HttpClient). There is less to learn and remember. . You essentially want to reduce knowing a lot of things so that you can focus on getting stuff done. . Code Cleanliness . Assuming React is used with Typescript, functional react with hooks is a much better way of creating components than class-based React and Angular. . Plus I like JSX (React) than HTML templating(Angular), it’s concise and there is less to remember. HTML templating in angular requires remembering an additional set of code (ngFor, ngIf, etc). In JSX, it’s the same language used while creating components. . The code structure is much better in angular projects. . Every angular project is structured similarly. . By default, CSS management is also better in angular. Every component has its own CSS. Parent components can have the same CSS namings and it would not affect child components unless specified (:host ::ng-deep). . React can also do this by using css modules. .",

Delay Gratification. Choose long-term over short-term. . The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool. . Humans are biased. We are emotional creatures. This can be a good thing and a bad thing. . Rationality allows for a next level thinking where decisions can be made from a birds 🦅 eye view and while knowing the long term effects. . Almost all rationality leads to long term thinking. .

There are many reasons for it which I’ll try to present in this post. . Typescript . Typescript is a super set of Javascript which means everything which is available in Javascript is automatically available in Typescript. . Typescript only adds a few extra features which are convenient for developers. . Typechecks . Probably the main reason to use typescript is this. . Having typechecks remove unneccesary errors. Types makes code more predictable. . Dynamically typed programming language have bad IDE support. . VS Code has fantastic support for Typescript with typeaheads which are and will probably always be missing with Javascript. . Everything is configurable. . Every typescript project has a “tsconfig.json” file which can be used to control everything typescript can do. . These include but are not limited to: . Where to put the final output | Ability to choose how strict the language is aka enable/disable following null checks | any assignments | etc | . | Shortcut paths | . Typescript compiles to JS . You don’t miss anything with typescript because in the end it compiles down to javascript. . You can choose which version of javascript to compile into from tsconfig.json file. . Typescript works fantastically with many libraries are framework. . Both major web libraries (React and Angular) support typescript. . How to transition from js to ts. . When you have a large application with lots of connected pieces, it makes sense to have connections between them standard. . So that as the application grows, the connections stay strong. And if parameters in a connection changes, it can be detected and changed at all places that use the connection. . This is missing in Dynamically typed languages like Javascript. But is available with a static checker like typescript. . . Typescript does only a few things: .

One has to give up the idea of being everyhing. And rather be something. . Values simplify decision making . Values are things that you regard highly and that you don’t compromise on. They can act as rough guidelines for making decisions. And also serve as a standard to judge your actions on. . Every individual is different, therefore it is important to build your own set of values to follow. Don’t borrow someone’s values. Define your own. . To have your values articulated, means you can use them much more easily into making decisions. . While this post talks about personal values, same can be applied to businesses. . “Core values are choices you make” . Some use cases for values . You can compare your core values with someone to see how aligned you are. Usually of you are aligned things to smoothly. 2 . You can usually pick up other’s value if you listen to them cuz most people essentially speak the same things over and over again. . If you have a particularly bad event, you can verify your actions on your values. You may find that you might not have lived up to your values fully. Or it maybe time to tweak your value a bit. . Tips for Finding and Picking Values . These are some of my tips for picking values: . Pick only a few values at first . I would recommend 3-4 at first and then adding a few overtime as need arises. | To pick the most personalized values, look at your past events. What motivated you make certain decisions? | . Shorter the length of each value the easier you can remember. Lesser the number of values, more you can remember. . Reframe your values to fit perfectly . Test and modify for your values. Maybe adding a few words would solidify a value which was previously too vague. | I have renamed my values multiple times where they essentially mean the same thing but with words that make more sense. | . Keep them as abstract as possible . The more abstract your values, the more decisions you can slot in to them. | . Compress. Don’t add a new value unless you absolutely need it . Value discovery is like finding new elements. You don’t want to add a new element if a value already exists. | . Build habits around them . You want your core values to be second nature. Build habits around each of them so that they stick long term. Habits need not be long, they need to be second nature. . Here are a few things I discovered: . I can develop habits around my values. -&gt; Identity Level Change | I can have a few people to look up to for each of my values.

Every sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.2 But as more and more people understand and use the technology, the magic fades and it becomes an everyday affair. . There are 3 interconnected factors that influence this: . Abstraction and Field Maturity | Demand and Cost | Education | Abstraction and Field Maturity . Abstraction makes it easy for programmers to learn new things. Open Source projects are best at these. . Every advanced technology eventually comes to a point where simple statements get the job done without need to understand details. . It takes long time for things to get polished. Open Source projects spend years perfecting things. . Web Technologies is probably in it’s most mature state. Like with Spring Boot: . You have integrations to include things like Batch Processing, Database Connectivity, Micro Services, Security, etc. | Each of which at one point in time were totally a big subject to learn and implement. Now most are a few hours of configuration. | . Like with Arduino: . Arduino has different environment, chips and hardware that make it easy for anyone to quickly prototype and test hardware products. | There are modules available for camera, microphones, sensors, etc. | All of which are abstracted and the only things connecting them are arduino and programming. | . Deep Learning: . Deep Learning is also getting to a state of maturity where things that required special knowledge are replaced with easy abstractions. | Frameworks like Tensorflow are providing out if the box solution for common activities like Recommender Systems. | . Research eventually give rise to applied applications. . Demand and Cost . More a product is needed, the more innovative solutions are made to make it cheaper and available to as many people as possible. #capitalism . Once it is available to more people, more innovative uses come out of it. . Software is cheaper to replicated therefore pace of innovation is much faster. . Hardware costs are variable in different countries. China has had a lot of hardware innovations because the cost of hardware is much lower due to high supply. . Role of Education . YouTube and online video in general has been a revolutionary technology. A man is limited to opportunities he/she gets. Online video allows for opportunity for everyone to learn the same thing. . Books are boring for most folks. . Space? . I believe once SpaceX reaches Mars, we’ll go through a similar cycle for space technology too.

One is only concerned with questions like the meaning of life if what they are doing in the present moment is not good enough to demand their full attention. | By becoming aware of the present moment we enjoy what life really is in the present. | And we have this power at any time of the day. | . You don’t have to have an opinion . You don’t have to have a personal opinion about everything. . Not exhaustive . Apart from Osho, Sadhguru and Sam would have a similar belief: . One of level, these concepts that the mind is the one that creates problems make sense. But I believe they shouldn’t be treated as exhaustive. . I have always wondered why buddhism advocates for both control of your mind and control of your actions. . This is probably because, just being control of your mind and letting the world fall apart is not only hard to achieve but it is stupid in some sense. We benefit a lot from facing and solving problems not only for ourselves but for the people around us. . Punctuate your day with moments . When talking about mindfulness, Sam Harris recommends following approach apart from a formal sitting practice: “Punctuate your day with moments of awareness.”. .

            "content": "While there are many techniques which are language agnostic, these are some of my favorites with Spring Boot. . Project Lombok . Use this if you don’t use Spring Boot with Kotlin. This will module will reduce side of code by around 15-25%. . Lombok allows you to generate java boilerplate at runtime by using Annotations such as: @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, @Getter/@Setter, etc. . My favorite onces are . @Data: A shortcut for @ToString, @EqualsAndHashCode, @Getter on all fields, and @Setter on all non-final fields, and @RequiredArgsConstructor. | @Cleanup: Automatically calls close() method in case of Streams and Connections. | . @RequestParam without Arguments . If the name of variable is same as value in @RequestParam, remove @Request Param. . Remove @Column on @Entity . In a @Entity, if the name of variable is same name of column writing @Column is unnecessary. . By doing this, not only remove a line from every variable, the quality of code is better as there is naming is consistent between DB and backend. . Use JPA @Repository Methods instead of Hibernate EntityManager/JdbcTemplate . Ideally your queries should be so simple such that the only type of read operation you do is simple CRUD. . Such simple queries are easier to understand and are a good sign of a well designed database. . Such operations are available out of the box with @Repository. .",

            "content": "By default in Spring Data JPA, when you save a list of entities a for…loop runs storing each record one at a time. . This would take a lot of time to execute. This is because the value of @Id often needs to be fetched from database and set to the @Entity before save. Therefore multiple transactions need to me made. . You can check this behavior by using the following application.properties and then checking logs. . spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true . Speeding Up Writes . Spring Data JPA allows for storing multiple records at once but multiple things have to be set first. . 1. Switch to Sequence Generator for primary key . Batch writes does not work with GenerationType.IDENTITY. . Make using sequence_generator . @Id @SequenceGenerator(name = &quot;seqName&quot;, sequenceName = &quot;seqName&quot;, allocationSize = {allocationSize}) private Long id; . The {allocationSize} is how many writes you wish to do at once in case of a large list of entities. . 2. Create the sequence in your database . Make sure that increment size is equal to {allocatedSize} used in @GenerateValue . 3. Add JPA Property . Add the following property . spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size={allocatedSize} . Within Code . repository.saveAll(listOfEntities); . How things work under the hood? . Once a list of entities need to be saved, JPA will make request to database for getting the next value of sequence generator. . This value will be set to the @Id of the first @Entity . Since we already have already provided {allocationSize}, JPA knows can automatically fill in values exist between the current value of sequence generator and the next. . Therefore JPA does not need to ask DB each time for the value to be set as primary key. . Example: . There is a sequence which increments by 1000. . We want to save a list of 500 entities to the database. . JPA asks database for value of sequence. . Database return value of 1. . JPA knows that the next increment is at 1000 so, it can fill in values between 1 and 1000. . JPA sets 1 to 500 to @Id field to entities. All the entities are together sent to the DB as a single transaction. . Suppose we get around want to save another 100 new entities. . JPA knows the last @Id it set was 500 and it was 499 more @Id values it can use. . So it for the new 100 entities, it set @Id values between 500-600 without asking Database for sequence value. .",

            "content": "Around 2 years ago, I wrote a blog post detailing how to keep backend DB Queries simple but it missed a very critical piece which is having a simpler DB. . This post highlights some of my DB preferences. A Database design is highly dependent on the application so there may not apply to every DB. . Aim for DB with Only Tables. No Stored Procedures, Functions or Views . Your DB for the most part should be such that the only operation you to CRUD and simple lookups. . Therefore a lot of effort should be taken to designing extremely reusable and simple tables. . In one of my projects, I had created an extremely efficient data pipeline. . Their were multiple views in a hierarchical tree calling one another. If you looked up on root view and applied some filters, you would get the data you want. This data needed to be inserted into a separate table so I created stored procedure to do it. . In coming months, new things were added the stored procedure and it became so complex that it is now to risky to tinker with. . Therefore now, I prefer DB which has no DB side functions or procedures, or if possible without views. If there is a complex query I every much prefer storing and triggering the queries from on the backend server. . There shouldn’t be multiple tables doing the same job. . Simple and Reusable Tables . If you have a social media type feature, it is best to have a single table to track likes than have multiple like tables for each type of data. . Column Names . For primary key id is enough. . Many prefer using &lt;table_name&gt;_id as primary key but adding table_name is unnecessary. We already know what table it is. . In case of joins between, &lt;table_name&gt;_id will be same length as selecting column with dot &lt;table_name&gt;.id. . Also, if you have just id you can quickly identify a foreign key which has column in this format &lt;table_name&gt;_id. . Indexing . I identify the columns which require joins or search. . And then index in the order in which they are called most. . Liquibase XML Format . Liquibase is a tool for managing DB Deployments. . Using something like Liquibase XML format allows you to be DB independent and makes migration easy. . For Complex Analytics Operations . For complex analytics use cron jobs to store data in separate table 1 or use Materialized Views 2 . TechLead &#8617; . | Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann &#8617; . |",

Though you won’t always build something awesome from scratch and instead configure an existing tool to do the job, without DevOps you won’t be free to code. You’ll spend all your time maintaining and deploying your code manually. In this post, I’ll try to convince you why upper management likes DevOps so much. Where did DevOps come from? . There are 2 separate engineers. . One who made the product -&gt; Developer | The other who made sure the product is running properly -&gt; Operations Engineer | . Operations Engineer’s role included: . Deploying application to server | Making sure it is operating properly | . Increasingly, some of the roles of Operation Engineers became so repeatable that it could be automated. Also, certain problems that operation engineer might face was much more easily handles if softwares were developed a certain way. . These gave rise to DevOps. . What is DevOps? . DevOps is a mixture if tools and practices that make it efficient to build and maintain code. . Agile is what to do. DevOps is how to do. . DevOps practices occupies different stages of product development and beyond. . DevOps is such a broad term with loose definition that many other concepts are plugged into DevOps as a “best practice”. For example: Pair Programming. . DevOps also get’s merged with security and called DevSecOps. Security is usually an afterthought. But DevSecOps aims to fix security problems in the phase that created it making it much less costly to fix it. . You cannot copy another organizations DevOps structure as it is. Your organization and products are unique. Make your own style. Don’t copy everything that google or facebook do, though you can learn a lot from them. . Since DevOps relies so much on automation tools, some things can be achieved faster. . Increase compliance | Streamlining of processes | Automating repeatable tasks | . All the tools and practices results to: . Increasing speed of deployments Very important to stay ahead of competition even if core of business is not software. | . | Increasing quality of software Allowing making changes easily and reducing bugs | . | Reducing cost of discovery and fixing issues Bugs discovered faster can be fixed early | All this reduces downtime. | . | . Some DevOps practices and accompanying tool that are very helpful are. . Build Automation: Jenkins | DB Automation: Liquibase, Flyway | Code Linting: Sonar, CAST | Continuous Integration (CI) | Continuous Delivery (CD) | Continuous Deployment (CD) | Continuous Monitoring: ELK, Databriks | API Management: Mulesoft | Test Driven Development (TDD) | Behavious Driven Development (BDD) | .

For Enterprise, recommender systems can help improve productivity by a lot. .

So I may be off in this post . Money . Money 💰 is a form of value. . A money is valid only if enough people are willing to enchange it for goods/services. . Once upon a time, sea shells 🐚 were used as value/money. But sea shells or other exhanges were hard to carry so later inventions such as coins, then cash and now money also includes numbers in a computer followed. . Value of Money . Money is only valuable when it is limited. If there is infinite money, the value of each individual unit will reduce and you need more money in exchange of same value. . Simplified example . Imagine there if there is 1000 unit of a currency in circulation. . At this place, 1 unit buys you a house. . Let’s suppose, the government decided to print more money and now 1000 more printed units are being added. . Now, the same house will hypothetically require 2 units of currency. . The value of single unit was reduced by half. . Commodity Currency . To avoid this, previously gold was used to set an upper limit. For each note you could exchange it for a real gold kept somewhere safe. This is called commodity currency. . There were even gold coins. If you had gold even if you don’t believe in the currency, you could still use it in other ways because gold was valuable. . Fiat Currency . But around 1960s in US, gold was removed because governments could not simply print money to pay of their debts. . This got called as Fiat currency. The current which has no backing. Enough people believe in the value of the fiat currency, therefore it is used ad money. . Essentially with fiat currency like dollar, government make life easier for them but at the same time make life difficult for normal people holding the money. . Cryptocurrencies . Cryptocurrencies remove this power from the government and aim to decentralize it amoung individuals. . Bitcoin has an upper limit. There can never be more 21 million and inflation in Bitcoin is accurately predictable. . Governments cannot just control how many bitcoins or another other decentralized currency are exchanged. . Money for most of history was believed and regulated by the free market. It is only in recent history that it became highly regulated and centralized by governments. . Cryptocurrencies can only succeed as long as enough people believe it is valid. .",

There is nothing in meditation that will give you insights about physical universe/galaxy. . Meditating at the same time and place is useful. . Have formal sitting practice in the morning before you do any major task. . Don’t be rigid while meditating. Let yourself flow. . Meditation is a activity which is weird for many.

            "content": ". Photo by prottoy hassan on Unsplash . Information is clutter. Applying information is power. . The more applicable information you can find, the more you can apply them and make better decisions. . Why information should be applied? . Information if not applied is meaningless unless it is your profession to find and document new information. . By applying information faster, you will solve your problems faster or at-least move towards solving your problems faster. . The information that is not applied will be forgotten. . You don’t always have time to sit and learn/consume something end to end. There is a high need for having on site learning mindset. Because it is the most optimal in terms of learning, applying and time. . Just in Case vs Just in Time . We fall into trap of consuming “just in case” information which we believe will be useful someday. Unless we are learning for fun, we should ideally focus on “just in time” information. . For example: While job searching, it is better to prepare while actively giving interviews than by waiting months before starting applying for jobs. The probability that you’ll have to relearn everything is high. . Catchup when need be 1 . It’s better to wait for a good amount of information to accumulate before consuming it rather than consume a constant stream of data. . A good way to follow this is to avoid all feeds and recommender systems. . Example: . Rather than consuming breaking news every few minutes, it’s better to let things accumulate for a day or so before consumption. Most breaking news is often low quality and is rarely important longterm. . Finding applicable information . There are many ways to find applicable information, these are a few that come to mind. . Planning . A plan may or may not be used, but planning is useful because it uncovers many aspects of the problem. Also, it is easier to discovers paths to avoid. . Questions . Frame your questions accurately. . Know the right people who can answer your question. Internet also allows us to connect to “experts” who are happy to answer you. . Specially having friends and colleagues you can rely on helps in avoiding pitfalls. . Googling the right way is also a key skill. . Reading Books . Some non-fiction books are made in a way where you can skip chapters liberally. Do so, close the book and live your life. . For other non-fiction books, you can do the same if you understand the topic enough. If you don’t, don’t skip because you’ll risk learning false information. . Being Multidisciplinary . Aspects from one discipline apply to other. Learn something random and you’ll find you apply the same principle in other field. . It see,s better to learn by categorizing. Like: A music instrument, a physical activity, a social activity, etc. . Mental Models and Heuristics. . These can help you find out more information about a topic faster by making good guesses. . Some of my favorite mental models are: . Inversion (Most Useful) | Occam’s razor | Map is not a territory | Confirmation Bias | Circle of Competence | Pareto Principle | . Make Time and Think . Thinking means you’ll question things from the first principles. To see if they are valid or not. . Then you scrutinize it. By thinking you find the solutions yourself and rely less on other sources. . Tim Ferriss &#8617; . |",

Our gadgets are such that they remove any need for thinking. We can find all information in minutes. . The problem this leads to is that we always search for a ready-made answer instead of thinking ourselves. . I have seen this during development a lot where some developers would search open-source solutions or paid solutions when in reality creating solutions was a just a few lines of code. . This happens because of not thinking. . Thinking . Thinking means you’ll question things from the first principles. To see if they are valid or not. . Then you scrutinize it. . Why . Individuals search for truth. Groups search for consensus. By always finding information rather than thinking, you increase your chances of being the same as others. Of course, logical facts are undeniable. . If you can think and articulate, you are powerful. You can influence people. People give you money. Ask for your advice. . Learning happens when you compare and contrast. Compare and contrast requires time to think. . Clear thinking also allows you to explain easily. . Your problems get solved when you think. . What you don’t use you lose. So make time to think. . Unprocessed thoughts . Unprocessed thoughts come out as garbage. . Unprocessed thoughts are not well articulated and come out as garbage. 1 . If you have unprocessed thoughts you fumble through life. 1 . About an hour a day should be good. . But if you haven’t processed your thoughts for long, it may take longer than a hour a day for a few days. . But it is important to remember unless this is absolutely a pain point to not let this be the only thing that’s on your plate. You have things to do and responsibilities to fulfil. . As you grow, the less manual work you have to do. And more decisions you have to make. . It’s better to spend 6 hours sharpening the ace and just spending an hour chopping down a tree than to do the opposite . So you’ll spend more time strategizing and learning rather than doing . Obstacles . Note-taking is problematic. By externalizing everything, you won’t think through well. One should only write what they think about a topic if something is new and carefully thought through. . The greatest obstacle to thinking is we resist boredom. Boredom is important as it sparks creativity. . Jordan Peterson &#8617; &#8617;2 . |",

            "title": "Summary of Marketing Section from The Personal MBA",
            "content": ". Marketing . Marketing is about finding the right prospespects, keeping their attention and make them interested in what you have to offer. Every business needs to do it because no matter how good your product is, you won’t have profit until your customers can find you. . Direct-Marketing sometimes reduces the lines between itself and sales because it reduces amount of time to close the deal. . But overall, Marketing and Sales are completely different activities. Marketing is about keeping attention. Sales is about closing the deal. . The product that does not sell without advertising. Will not sell with advertising. . Attention . The number 1 rule of marketing is that attention is limited and every other company is trying to grab attention. . People are only interested in things they like and the things that are important to them. Therefore high quality attention is important. And high quality attention must be earned. . At the same time, the aim is not be popular. The aim is to increase profits. So if you can get yourself on TV, you’ll be popular but you’ll waste a lot of time not finding the right customer. . Receptivity . People ignore what they don’t care about. . Receptiveless is how open a person is to your message. There are three parts to this: message, timing and medium . Message: The person should be interested in the message you are offering. Timing: The person should recieve the message at the right time. Medium: The person should recieve message from the right medium. Example: A personlized message will likely be more effective than same commercial message to every person. . From a business perspective, you want your customers to be as receptive as possible. . Remarkability . Remarkability is being enough different to pique the interest of your customers. Being remarkable voiletes customer’s usual expectations and grabs their attention for free. . High remarkability generated word of mouth. Advertisement is what is done when you are not remarkable (or not remarkable enough). . Probable Purchaser . Assuming everyone will purchase your product is bad. There are only a set of people who would. So it makes no sense to try to appeal to everyone. . Appeal to the right customer at the right time. Every good marketing compain does this. . Preoccupation . Always assume that your prospect has preoccupied himself/herself with something. Your goal is to be interesting enough so that you can grab their attention. . The threshhold for this maybe low or high depending on your environment and type of product. . Level of Awareness . You need to be sensitive to how much your probable customer cares about your offer. . There are 5 levels to this: . Unaware | Problem Aware | Solution Aware: Knows solution but not aware of specific offer | Offer Aware | Full Aware | Your goal is to identiy the level the prospect is at the push them towards upper level -&gt; The Funnel. . The best way to do it is to personalize your message for each prospect and level. . End Result . Humans don’t always do what the think they are doing. Eg: People who buy SUV don’t use it for it’s purpose. They use it to feed their status. . Find out what they really desire and appeal to it. . Ankush: Combine this with Education Based Selling. You cannot sell loads of crap just because it makes someone feel high status. . Demonstration . Demonstration is one of the oldest tricks which significantly increases probability of sale. . Demonstrate your product to the customer. Make them use it. Let them see the results themself. This removes a lot of doubts the prospect may have. . Qualification . It is better to screen prospects and find the right customers that to have bad customers. This has to happen before sale. . Ideally your funnel should remove bad customer. Bad onces will consume un-neccesary time, attention and resources. . After that you can focus on better serving the right once. . The prospect who is not right for you may be right for your competitors. You don’t have to be jumpy about not serving bad prospects, help them by refer them to competitors. . Point of Market Entry . Point of market entry is the point at which the random prospect becomes interested in finding the solution to the problem. . Certain markets have obvious entry point and exit point. . Having the attention of the prospect during point of entry is valuable because the prospect will set you as a standard while comparing with your competitors. This increases your likelihood of sale. . Point of entry is the reason why organic and paid-ad search are so valuable. . Addressability . There are certain problems and types of prospects that open up in public. These can be sensitive issues. . So you’re not going to find a TV Ad style boadcast to do much of a trick or expect a viral word of mouth recommendation. . But you can position yourself in places where they are more liekly to find you. . For example for sensitive health issues, doctors are an easy medium to get to your prospect compared to TV ad. . Nowadays people also Google the solution to their problem, therefore targetted ads are also useful. . Addressability is how easy it is to get in touch with your prospects. Ideally you wannt high addressibility. . If you choose an already addressable market, you’ll reduce your efforts significantly. . Desire . Desire is one of the part of marketing that get’s people off. If someone does not desire your product, no one will purchase it. . Scammy marketters are people who promise a product which is different for what they deliver. But it is almost impossible to sell someone something that they don’t desire. . Your goal is not to appeal to people who don’t desire, it is to find people who can convince themself of how your offer will benifit them. . The more core human drives your marketting offer connects to the more effective it will be. . Visualization . When your work speaks for itself, don’t interrupt. . Test driving is one of the most effective tactics. The prospects stop rationlizing, the emotional part of their brain takes in and they start wanting. Once that is done, it is only a matter of time before sale is made. . Our minds are designed to visulize the consiquences of our actions. By making it easy (by putting as much sensory info as possible) for your prospects to visulize how purchasing the product solves the problem and makes them feel, they will conclude with “I want this”. . Framing . Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. . Framing a natural form of communication. There is always some sort of compression when we tell the image. Therefore it pays attention to be concious about it. . Framing your communication to be persuasive and exact can get the point accross faster while honoring the listener. . Framing is not same as deciet, you are not lying. . While framing make sure that the listener know what they need to know because if not done it will harm your reputation. . Free . Getting attention is not the same as getting paid. . Offering free value is a quick way to attract potential customers. But the free value should be such that additional sales negate the amount of resources spent of free. . Done well, this will lead to sales you wouldn’t otherwise have made. . Permission . No one likes spam. So it is better to ask for people’s permission to send them more information in case of newletters, phonecalls, etc. . Do not abuse your privilage. if you keep you keep providing real value in those newsletters, etc. you’ll find more people interested in your paid offering and will create a deeper relationship with the prospect. . Before asking for permission, make it clear what they’ll be getting and how it will benifit them. . This is the next best thing since it reduces marketing cost and increase likelyhood of prospect purchase overtime. . Hook . The smaller your message, the less likely people are to forget it. . Hook is a small enough message that keeps people’s attention and conways to them what you are offereing and who you are. It also makes it easy for people to tell about you to their firends. . Examples: . A million songs in your pocket -&gt; IPod | 4 hour work week | . Hook can be title, subtitle, slowgan etc. Use it in as many places as possble. . Generate a lot of hooks and test which onces work. . The hook grabs attention and the remainder of your marketing sales activities close the deal. . Call To Action (CTA) . Your prospects won’t know what to do next, so tell them and make it obvious for them. CTA should be simple, single and obvious. . Best CTA ask for either sale or permission to follow up. . Ensure that every message you create has a clear CTA. . Narrative . A common format of a narrative is “Hero’s Journey”. The hero recieves call of adventure and overcomes obstacles to achieve his goals. . The customer wants to be a hero. Knowing that others are already walked on the path makes it easy for them to follow the path themself. . Therefore testomonials, case studies and other stories make it easy for customer to choose your call to adventure. . Controversy . If your position is to agree with everyone else, then you’ll become boring. . Controvery means taking a stand for something you care about even if people disagree with it. Controversy promote discussion and attract peopl’e attention. . Not all controversty is good. As logn as you are able to maintain a sense of bigger picture of how you’re trying to help, a bit of controvery can create useful awareness. . Reputation . Like it or not, the market’s perception becomes your perception. . Branding often means increasing and maintaining reputation. . People are willing to pay to premium for a good reputation. . Reputation is not under direct control you can only try to improve it overtime. It includes everything: products, advertisement, customer service, etc. . Building reputation takes time and effort but is one of the most important marketing out there. .",

And therefore they won’t use your product. . Sympathize with the user. . The way to understand what the users want is by sympathizing with the struggles that user’s face. . Test fast . The earlier you can get feedback from the user, the shorter your product development cycle will be. . The user can only know what he/she likes when he/she can experience the product. But since product development takes resources, prototyping helps to make the process faster. . The fastest way to do it is to create paper prototypes. Paper is inexpensive, quick and has zero learning curve. . You can prototype not just User Interface but also physical products. . Once the paper prototype is created, you can increase the fidelity of the prototypes. . If a picture can say a thousand words, a prototype can save a thousand meetings. . It’s best to involve the end-users as much as possible in the design process. . The prototype also helps engineers to build exactly what the end-users want and reduces overall development time. . UI is part of UX, not the other way around. . UX includes more than the User Interface. It includes every interaction the user has with the product or the company. . UX is concerned with how the user feels when using the product and not just how it looks. . Such things can include reducing the number of steps needed to perform a task. .

Entrepreneurs find a problem, solve it, and earn money as a reward. . In capitalism terms, money is proof that you are adding value to the world. 1 . Those who don’t own a business, help others by becoming an employee, thus adding value. . The Path To High Impact Is Through Capitalism . It is efficient to adapt ourselves to the world than to do the opposite. Money is a form of trust. . You’re going to need money to have the effect of any kind and at any stage. Being a capitalist (employee or entrepreneur), providing value, and being compensated with cash is the best way to do it. . Capitalism + Ethics . Capitalism is not perfect. If not kept in check, it can turn evil (Example: East India Company) and provide no value. . Ethics is not intrinsic to capitalism. And it probably never be as it is hard to map out. A combination of the two leads to more results than one or the other. . Ethics enables you to play long-term games, be trustworthy and win social trust. . The mix of the two is probably why companies like Apple and Tata Group are so successful and trusted for so long. They provide high value while not compromising on ethics. . It seems better to think in terms of adding value than to think in terms of money. . Naval Ravikant &#8617; . |",

Most OSS are libraries for developers to use. . Some exceptions are Signal, VLC and Chrome. . Why companies make their project open source? . Recognition . Companies, especially smaller ones, gain a lot of recognition by being developing open-source software. An example of this is BaseCamp which built Ruby on Rails. . Market Capture . Enterprises and even smaller companies prefer free open source software over the paid ones if it gets their work done faster. . Hiring . Open-source software help companies find and recruit good talent. Though it is likely not the main reason for making open-source software. . Revenue . Most companies don’t depend on their open-source software for profit. . The once which do usually rely on: . Donations | Provide additional proprietary features at Premium. Like: Cloud Support. | Problems with open source . Not all OS projects are equal. Some projects are better maintained than others. . Sustainability . The revenue does not seem sustainable. The companies which only focus on open source products either require a lot of Donation (like Ubuntu) or have to pivot heavily to be sustainable (like RedHat recently) . Deception and Priorities . OSS often doesn’t openly admit to having bugs. If a developer knows of bugs in the OSS they can choose not to use the product. But usually, developers get to realize the bugs themself after a few months of using the products. . Critical bugs may be ignored as open-source projects have their own set of priorities. Sometimes the prioritize the number of issues fixed over addressing critical once. There is low/no accountability 1 since it is free. . Paid products provide priority support for paid customers, thus resolving issues faster. . When choosing an open-source project, check GitHub issues first. 1 . Also, open-source projects do get abandoned which does not happen with paid products. . Flutter EXPOSED: Extreme JANKY animations. “A nightmare framework” &#8617; &#8617;2 . |",

One should be ethical so that once’s mind isn’t corrupt when facing life’s challenges 2. . So that once can act sane and not make things worse. . Reducing decision fatigue . A side effect of being ethical is that you’ll have fewer decisions to make. You can instantly eliminate un-ethical once. . The price you pay not being ethical . Your habits and actions are proofs to yourself of the kind of person you are. 3 . If you take the same behaviour and stretch it to a lifetime, you will likely be in a very different place to where you are. . The direction of things is more important than the speed at which you achieve them because you could end up in a very different place. . Long Term Greedy 4 . Being ethical is being greedy long term. . The hallmark of any compounding process is short term pain for long term reward. . For example: If people know you are ethical, they trust you more. They’ll be more likely to do deals through you. 4 . Example 2: If you are ethical, you are surrounded by ethical people. 4 . Being ethical includes a lot of short term pain for a future reward. . Having nothing to hide. 4 2 . Being ethical allows you to tell the truth almost always and not be afraid of the consequences. . Node in a network . Your actions and decisions are more than yours. They are a ripple in a network 2. . If you can affect 1000 people positively, they might do that same to other people. Positive things branch out like a tree. . Meaning . Ethics provide life more meaning. . A meaningful life is more exciting and fulfilling. . Rights and Responsibilities . Rights and responsibilties is how you create trust and have a fare trade. .

It transitions fast and beautifully from one topic to another. . It also presents arguments and counter-arguments in a way that tries to explain the whole thing from maximum points of view. This kind of writing and thinking is something I aspire. . Lessons . Cousins . We had a lot of cousin humans. Once upon a time, Around six species of humans roamed the earth at the once. | We are not unique. 3 billion years ago our universe was born. It will stay for billions. We are not even the human species that has survived the longest (as of yet). | There are countless species. We are just specie that got lucky thanks to our intellect and imagined realities. | Imagined Realities . History is random. There are cause and effect to certain events but there is no reason why history could not have turned in some other way. | Religion is a recent thing. (10,000 years ago). | The way we interact and work together with stranger and form groups larger than 150 is by imaging things. | Societal constructs like nation, company, ethics, etc are imagined realities shared by billions. It’s so strong that we act according to them in the real world. | There is no justice in history. Even a human right is an imagined construct. There is nothing in biology that suggest it to be a truth. These constructs do help keep people sane. | Destroyer of Species . Huntergathers were healthier than us but they did not live for that long. | There is no going back once the Agriculture Revolution started. Why would someone want to go back to hunting? | We are Thanos for other species. Our species has captured and killed and effected almost all animals on earth. | We don’t look at animals with the same view as we look at other humans. We abolished human slavery but are okay with animal slavery. | Capitalism . Science is largely a product of Capitalism and politics. | Capitalism allowed us to progress fast. | Capitalist if not checked can do anything for money. Slave trading companies were listed in the London Stock Exchange. This seems kind of similar to current privacy breaching companies or how we farm animals. | The stock investor would not care what happens in the company. he is just interacted in making a return. | Government and legal checks are necessary to keep Capitalists in check. | Accepting Ignorance . The scientific revolution was a result of Europeans accepting that they are ignorant. That they don’t know things. | The reason the Scientific revolution took place in Europe instead of India or China (even if Asia controlled 80% of world GDP) is because of social constructs. | Asians did not accept their ignorance and did not venture out to find answers to things they did not know. | New material discovered increase progress rapidly. | Unification . The 3 things that brought humankind together; Empired, Religion, Money. | Money crossed lines which religion could not. Everybody loves money. | There have been many types of money and does not include just a coin. | We are all influenced by European culture. No country has an original culture. It’s a mix. | Math . Maths allowed us to predict the future. | Time and timetable tracking is recent. Though it is very efficient. | Buddhism . Western liberals mix their view with the Buddhist view. | The Buddhist view is not that the happiness in individual and it must be protected. | The main part is the internal states are fleeting and they change every moment. There is no point in chasing after it. | Credit . Banks and the whole financial system are built on credit. They provide more money than they have hoped for a future return. This is a large contributor to human progress. . Lone Individual . Individual needs are now satisfied by state and organizations instead of family and community. . If you want money, you can take a loan. | if you want an education you go to school. | if you are unemployed there are un-employment schemes. | if you are old, there are retirement schemes. | . Transendance . Humans have transcended genetic boundaries. . We learn faster and adapt quicker. Unlike other animals whose genes dictate what they do. | We have created medicines and technologies that far exceed and extend our natural limitations. | . Communication . A band of good communication sapiens of 500 could beat Neanderthals with a pack of 5 times more. | Gossip is natural to us. Gossip conveys important information like who to avoid, what to do, what not to do, etc which helps us be safe. | Peace in our time . Humans have been safer than ever. And we seem to be moving towards more peace. | Compared to history, the decolonization of colonies has been relatively peaceful. Everyone seems to be tired of war. | Nature . Biology is always changing. It is never constant or fixed. If you go by this line of thinking, more than human 2 genders are possible and biology won’t have any problem with it. .",

The amount of effort required to research in the pre-colonial and colonial era was far greater. This should increase productivity and it does in some sense. But it has lead to a reduction of effort on the human part and therefore the result is the same. . Research . Research gets an entitlement. People think it is hard. . It’s likely how people define it. You just have to work at something. And if you work on it you may discover things that you don’t even know are new. . The reason research gets a bad entitlement of because of ready-made solutions and the things that are already been discovered/made. . We miss the point that all the polished discoveries we see today had humble beginnings. . I would argue that if the discovery you made or a solution you made even is it already exist and you didn’t know about it is still an act of research. You may even find some improvements. . The act of research does not have to be big. . Ready-made solutions - Globalisation . Globalisation has allowed us to take fruits of someone else’s research. . As of 2020, China and the USA dominate technology. We Indians (and many from other countries) are more of a witness to this domination. . There are also different issues to solve.

A non-technical person does not know the problem that can be solved using technology. . A technical person does not know what problems to solve. The result is that time is solved solving problems on trivial issues like social media instead of more important fields. . How other fields can benefit . Some fields have slow progress rate. There is a long delay in medical research getting to production (Approx 20 year 1). There hasn’t been much innovation in the field even in engineering fields like Civil engineer or biotechnology. . The reason is likely because these fields require physical products and take longer to build and test. A technology solution can help speed up some of their processes. . Graphics Modelling and Simulations to speed to testing | Data Organization and Retrieval Systems to make sure the right information is accessed. | Deep Learning Models to help search for replacing overdependence of specialized hardware. | Automation of manual tasks | . The best way to ensure these fields get benefits of innovations in computer technology is to work closely with experts in the field or to get into it ourselves. .

Earlier, I was avoiding the cloud because it seemed very hard. But like every computer science buzzword, it is much much easier than expected. . Recently I started learning AWS. These are a few things that have changed my mind. . Cost: Pay only for what you use . Cloud is anyway cheaper than building and maintaining your server. . The cost can be optimized further by setting up things properly. . Cost is impacted by decisions such as: . Pay per minute | Different cost for different configuration | Pay per GB of data stored | . And cloud vendors themselves provide options and encourage customers to optimize their usage to reduce cost. . Rapid Availability . Resources are available to you the instant you want them and in the location, you want them at. . If I were to start a Deep Learning project, on my local machine, it would take a full workday to just set things upright. Plus, you’ll have to deal with upgrades and maintenance yourself. . The same thing I wanted to do on AWS, it took just 3 minutes. . Special Hardware . In fields like Machine Learning, you need high computation and specialized hardware. . A cloud provider can provide it instantly. . Similarly, Quantum Programming is a new field for programmers that were not available to most developers. But cloud providers are providing infrastructure for this new field. . Choice: “We’ll provide infrastructure. Your code!” . Traditionally, if you buy hardware and it is not used, you cannot do much other than selling the hardware to reclaim the cost. . Cloud solves this problem by allowing users to change their underlying infrastructure at any moment. . Maintainance: “We’ll provide support. You code!” . Small things like replication of the servers and databases, scaling, sharding, maintaining security, etc are automatically taken care of with a few clicks. . Cloud vendors provide a good set of defaults and out of the box solutions to these common problems. . Abstraction: Easier than Traditional Setup . Cloud vendors make it easier to use the cloud. Things are abstracted and one can choose to learn until what is required. . Most normal developers would not have to deal with specifics of the infrastructure. . Special APIs: Code less . Almost all cloud providers provide special APIs for things like text recognition, image recognition, and even blockchains. . One need not be an expert to use these out of the box solutions. . Conclusion: Cloud is a Win-Win . Cloud provides a lot of consumer surplus. . Cloud is such that the price of owning and maintaining for the individual user than if they would have built a server themselves. . While for the cloud provider, it is also cheap because they provide it at scale. . Not to mentions, they are easier to use and provide the flexibility of choice. .",

Books are of higher quality because they go through a lot of “processes”. Other mediums do not. Draft-&gt;Editors-&gt;Reviews-&gt;Publisher. . Reading is also an antidote to shortened attention span. . If you can really read, then you can read way faster than you can listen or watch. . Habit . Keeping distractions away while reading helps. . To start, read anything. Even a page better than no page. . Reading slowly is okay. You may finish the book in 3 months. Not a big deal. . Medium . Reading on a phone 2 is great if you can manage to keep distraction beyond. . Reading physical books is ideal. 3 . You can listen to an audiobook as a last resort but it likely won’t be fulfilling and you won’t remember details. 1 . New words . If you don’t know a word in the book, learn it right there and there. If you don’t you are just approximating what the author says. . If you are going to read a series of 📚 then learn each new word. The same word will be used later. . Selecting books to read . Reading from different categories is an easy way to broaden your perspective. . Always be reading at least 2 books, fiction, and non-fiction. . Non-fiction: Makes you more informed and puts things into action. | Fiction: Makes you less boring and counteracts the overthinking created by non-fiction. | . Don’t buy non-fiction books that have just been released. Let the reviews come in. . If the right book is selected, it is worth paying the price. . Reading foundational books like History of something or mathematics rather than diving into the latest trends allows you to broaden your understanding and remember faster 31. . Speed Reading . Reading speed increases naturally as you get into a habit of reading regularly. . Your reading speed is higher when you read a topic you are familiar with. It is slower when you read something new. . Therefore if you are speed reading, it is probably not worth reading that book. 1 . There is nothing wrong with reading slow. Big abstract concepts require time 3. . Reasoning . Don’t agree with everything you read. Authors are humans too. 4 . Put yourself in the shoes of the author and try to reason through his conclusions. . You want to internalize the author’s thinking/mindset so that you can see the problem from his point of view. 1 . Reading books that provide a counter-argument to your thought or to a book you have read is also interesting. . If you don’t understand a certain section or a concept, google/youtube it and clear it. . Memorize . Book notes make it easy to non-only reason but to memorize the gist of the book. . Don’t copy-paste. Write in your own words. It should be your thoughts. | . The narrative makes it easy to remember. Some non-fiction books have a narrative too. . You can choose to read fiction instead of non-fiction for the same topic. . Get interested in big picture first. Get interested about the author. You’ll be interested about the book. .

Their role has nothing to do with their skills, rather they have “years of experience” so it is weird for others to keep them at the bottom position. . Pain to ideas/people around them and always wants things to be their way because “I said so” + Micromanagement . Chooses to be a leader . A person who chooses to be a leader regardless of their position in the organization. . He/She . sees a problem and proposes a solution | takes on responsibilities | delivers on them | disagrees with a process/method/idea when it is needed but provides proper reasoning and is ready to discuss over it if needed | debates and let’s the best idea win | . If someone is stuck, he/she helps them and doesn’t just leave them i.e he/she is a good team member. . Treats everyone the same regardless of their title. . . It is fun to see people’s behavior around you and think about what type of leader they are. .",

Therefore earning you money/opportunities forever. . A few years ago you could easily see people Monopolize a category just within a few months of uploading. . A few changes happened between 2013 to 2020 (now) that seem to have effected this notion. . Competition and Similar Content . The amount of people uploading and watching “content” has exploded. . If a few years ago the same content would have less competition. But now not just the content has to compete with other similar content but also over factors like freshness. . Reducing attention span . Personalized Recommendation Engines . Bigger companies saw value in the shift in attention towards online sources and exploding data. . Since the amount of data has increased, the recommendation algorithms designed to keep people engage and make advertisers happy are getting more and choosy. . Personalized Search Engines . A few years go personalize results only appeared for feeds, now appear in normal search results too. This means that everyone who searches for something gets different results. . But this also means that you are more likely to target your specific demographic as the algorithm thinks it is the right fit. . These all lead to change in SEO strategy . The basic search engine optimization (SEO) methods like keyword optimization and backlinking no longer work as well as effectively as they used to. These methods were more or less automatic and easy for people to make their websites reach people easily. . The newer methods which work along with are basic SEO strategies are more analog. A person has to decide how to come up with these: . Site-specific strategies like Thumbnail and Timestamp on Youtube, | Creating a ‘brand’ account and promoting | Engaging and trying to retain users with witty and regular posts/stories | . Conclusion . The newer methods of engagement are more work than what they were a few years ago. . At the same time, the result of these efforts is more shorten as the same strategy is applied by every other content generator. . The role of automation in content marketing is getting smaller while that of strategy is getting larger. . Photo by Stephen Phillips - Hostreviews.co.uk on Unsplash .",

Every-time you show something you cooked or something you made… the first reaction from people is… why don’t you open a business?? . No! This is something I do for fun… . There is no real ROI! I don’t want to be famous or make money with this. . Life requires activities that have no other purpose than the joy that activities itself provides.1 . If suddenly there is an expected ROI attached it has a probability of not being fun anymore. Though the result of having an expected ROI to a hobby is that the quality and quantity of output increase a lot. . Hobbies are an active process: The more effort that has been put in the higher is the reward. 1 . Consumption: Books, Media, and Games . One of the things that many consider being a waste of time is consumption. Often quotes float around which says something on the lines of Make your own life so exciting that you don’t need to consume anything else. .

Hell yeah! ROI was higher. . | Was watching One Piece a waste of time? No. I actually enjoyed it. | Did I get my positivity pumped? Definitely. | . Most consumption only impacts the mindset of the consumer and does not result in direct action. The tricky thing is that we don’t know what will get us inspired or changed perspective for the better. If we did knew it already, it would be pretty boring. . Consumption is a passive process: You don’t have to actively work at it. . People . I actually don’t know how to write this without giving my personal anecdotes. So if you are a programmer explore this section in the DOM 😬. . I have been guilty of setting very high standards for people around me and for my behavior towards them too. It is not something I do consciously nor it is something I want to do. The people around me have always been supportive, caring and made me less bored. We are not dealing with creatures of logic. These are people just like me with emotions, ups/downs, discomforts, strengths, and weaknesses. We are social animals made to support each other during the bad and the good. I was and am always available for my friends/family when a problem arose in their life and they need me. But I was never there to share happy moments with them too. Dealing with people is both active and passive: Active: To be there to be for them when a problem arose and they need. Passive: To be there to share their happiness.

Along with these were concepts such as Algorithms and Data Structures. All these in effort to make original programs. . What we do . Increasingly I have realized that most of what we do is not creating functionality from scratch. . These are the kind of things I do regularly: . Wanted to add zoom in zoom out on images: OpenSeaDragon module | Wanted to generate PDF on the client-side: jsPDF module | Wanted trailer videos: TheMovieDB API | Idle session timeout alert: ng-idle | Want to talk to a DB: Spring Data JPA | Wanna have a table on a page: I don’t write my HTML tables. I use DevExpress. | Want my website to be installable on Mobile/Desktop: @angular/pwa module | . Programming role for the most part is to configure other’s code/modules/APIs so that it works well along with other modules and our tiny code. . And whatever tiny code that we do write is rarely even unique. For the most part, it is either the same functionality as something built before or copy/pasted from StackOverflow or Github. . Also for a good amount of things, one can easily skip backend coding by using something like Firebase. . Code Generators and Configuration Files . I wanted to contribute to PyTorch so I read their code and understood nothing. . I thought I had enough Python &amp; DL skills but that was not the problem. . The point was they have ATEN: a kind of configuration language that allows them to generate programs in their target language on the Fly. . A topic similar to code generators are configuration files such a .properties or .yaml . I love these. The behavior of the application can be changed entirely using configuration files. For these to be most effective the entire application has to be built with configurability in mind. . 80/20 split . I used to despise DevOps earlier because I never wanted to leave programming behind. After all, a major part of DevOps is configuring tools. But I realize now that ROI is huge. . I still believe that learning the principles are more important than learning a specific technology. . Learning a principle such as Deep Learning means that underlying technological tools such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, or even AutoML matter very little. . These principles (20%) apply to a small by very important parts (80%): . deciding what to do | connecting different modules | debugging | . Similar: Make your code configurable .",

These are some things I found helpful when deciding on a new language or framework or module. . Deciding to learn . I pick something to learn only when the language/framework… . has been around for at-least a few year | is under active development and is likely to stay | has good community support/tools | . I find it easier to learn something by category like: . Frontend: Angular | Backend: Spring Boot (Currently with Java) | Database: SQL (pretty much all SQL are same) | Deep Learning: PyTorch | Containerizing: Docker | Hardware: Ardruino (C++) | Game Development: Yet to be decided | . The benefit of learning by category is that same skills can apply to other categories. . Like: My pandas (python) skills helped me a lot during new SQL problems. . Photo by Markus Winkler on Unsplash . Deciding not to learn . I hate learning “new” languages/framework/technology especially when . it does the exact same thing that I can do now | does not add any new benefit | it’s old/outdated | if I’ll likely never use it | proprietary technology | . So, . no AngularJS after learning Angular. | nothing less than Spring Boot when doing Java. | Typescript &gt; Javascript. | PyTorch is probably enough. Don’t need Tensorflow. | SQL is enough. No need of NoSQL yet. | . Exceptions . There have always existed exceptions and cases where I just needed to learn something. . Old but need it: Had to learn excel to reverse engineering and build same feature in Spring Boot | Learning a good framework: Had learned Django before. After joining worked I learned Spring Boot and realized it much better. | Made life easy: My application UI was crap. Easiest way was to learn CSS myself without using Bootstrap. It was easier than I expected. Thanks Fireship. | For Future: I may learn a little Firebase just to see how fast I can develop applications in it. Hopefully transferring some of that knowledge to my daily coding. | . But most exceptions occur where I either had to do it or see a benefit that is transferrable to what I do. . . I try not to learn something just to add to resume or to list of things that just sound cool (sometimes I do). . I usually spend months deciding. . YouTube videos and written articles have been great help when deciding. .",

Commit Version 3: Improvements . Changes: Proper Accuracy, Graph, and Data Normalization . Day 4 . | Score — 0.96 . | Time invested — about an hour . | . Proper Accuracy . Accuracy should always be calculated on the validation set. . Creating a separate validation set . val_len = int(len(ds)*0.01) # 0.01 percent of data train_len = len(ds) — val_len # all other are in training from torch.utils.data import random_split train_ds, val_ds = random_split(ds, [train_len, val_len]) . Likewise, 2 data loaders are created. . bs = 64 train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, bs) val_dl = DataLoader(val_ds, bs) . Changes in the training loop . A separate list called accuracies in created to store the accuracy of an epoch. . ... with torch.no_grad(): accuracy = 0 for images, labels in val_dl: out = net(images.float()) accuracy+=(out.argmax(dim=1) == labels).sum().item() accuracies.append(accuracy/len(val_ds) * 100) . Graph . Since the accuracy of each epoch was stored in a separate accuracies list, creating a graph was easy. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot(range(epochs), accuracies) . Data Normalization . After plotting the graph, I realized accuracy was 43% which is the same as the score of commit 2. . The easiest thing to do was to normalize the data. . Since MNIST images are in the range of 1…250 the easiest thing to do was to divide by 250 which would result in a range of 0…1. . Ideally, the range should be around 0 so an even better approach would be . image = image/250–0.5 . this would result in a range between -0.5…+0.5. . Later we would use torchvision.transforms.Normalize(mean, std, inplace=False) which generates unique normalization value for each dataset . Commit 6: ConvNet, and GPU . Day 6 . | Score — 0.97 . | Time invested — about 2 hours (lots of googling and reading docs) + 1 hours fixes bugs . | . ConvNet . Convolutional Neural Networks are ideal images. . ResNet . ResNet 34 is my goto ConvNet but since MNIST is so easy, I went with ResNet 18. . import torchvision.models as models resnet18 = models.resnet18(pretrained=True) resnet18.fc #print fully connected network . ResNet is designed to output 1000 classes. But our output is from 0…9 aka 10 classes. . lin_in = resnet18.fc.in_features import torch.nn as nn resnet18.fc = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(lin_in, 10), nn.Softmax(dim=1) ) . Convert Grayscale to RGB image . ResNet expects RGB images. MNIST is grayscale. . img = img.view(3, 28, 28).expand(3, 28, 28)` . This grayscale to the RGB line is added to our Dataset class. . Normalization . When using an existing model, we need to use the same normalization values as that model. The docs mention the normalization value. . import torchvision.transforms as transforms normalize = transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) . The init and getitem dataset class have been modified to use this transformation. . Modifications have also been made to test_ds. . GPU . One I started the training loop, I realized it suddenly became too slow. . GPU is needed! . device = torch.device(&#39;cuda:0&#39;) if torch.cuda.is_available() else &#39;cpu&#39; . If the GPU is on, the device will be cuda. . The neural network and the data in training, validation and texting loop have been changed to run on GPU. . net = net.to(device) ... images, labels = images.to(device,dtype=torch.float), labels.to(device) . And since we are on GPU we can increase our batch size from 64 to much higher. . I experimented with a few sizes from 320…640 and kept an eye on GPU utilization and settled for 512. . . I did the same for num_worker which specifies the number of threads to load a batch. This is CPU stuff. . Along with monitoring GPU and CPU usage, I modified training_loop to show the amount of time taken to complete each epoch. . bs = 512 num_workers = 2 train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, bs, num_workers=num_workers) val_dl = DataLoader(val_ds, bs, num_workers=num_workers) . This resulted in 7 seconds per epoch. . For testing, the batch_size can be much higher since we don’t have to back prop. . Commit 7: Improvement . Day 8 . | Score — 0.97 . | Time invested — about 30 minutes . | . I learned that you don’t need nn.Softmax if you are using nn.CrossEntropyLoss. . nn.CrossEntropyLoss has nn.Softmax built-in and the results of softmax are not used during back-prop. So it can be safely removed. . Now FC is this: . lin_in = resnet18.fc.in_features import torch.nn as nn resnet18.fc = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(lin_in, 10) ) . .

It requires a mindset shift. Looking at the code through an artist’s eye. . . Incremental Improvements . If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code simply could not rot. The cleanup doesn’t have to be something big. Change one variable name for the better, break up one function that’s a little too large, eliminate one small bit of duplication, clean up one composite if statement. . Can you imagine working on a project where the code simply got better as time passed? . ~ Rober C. Martin (Author of Clean Code) . Maybe, improve one microservice. | . Tip: Leave TODO as comments for your future self. These could include how you want to improve the code but don’t have time right now to do it. Hopefully your future self will handle it. . Upgrading Fast (get rid of Legacy) . Newer languages and frameworks provide many more features, provide security upgrades and are easier to use. The longer you wait to upgrade, the harder the upgrading becomes. . You will also find that clean code is much easier to upgrade. . Do it one step at a time. . Making a big bang change is never feasible. . Upgrading can come in a variety of sizes. . Simple upgrades such as — Custom SQL executors in code to using an ORM. . Get rid of prepared statements and replace them with Spring Data JPA | . Or they can be a little bigger such as — Going from AngularJs to Angular. . Developers of the code to provide guides and tools to make upgrading frameworks easier . Like: Official guide for upgrading from AngularJS to Angular. . The above guide mentions some things that are worth mentioning here: . Some applications will be easier to upgrade than others, and there are many ways to make it easier for yourself. It is possible to prepare and align AngularJS applications with Angular even before beginning the upgrade process. These preparation steps are all about making the code more decoupled, more maintainable, and better aligned with modern development tools. That means in addition to making the upgrade easier, you will also improve the existing AngularJS applications. . Or a much bigger one like — Going from Java to Kotlin. . Choosing a programming language is a hard process. . Ideally, you would want to choose something which is: . Non-proprietary . | In-expensive or FREE . | Easy to code in . | Flexible enough . | . Java to Kotlin . Enterprises seem to have got stuck with Java 8 (released in 2017) because it is free. The newer versions of Java offer much better and easy to use features but enterprises won’t upgrade. . Kotlin might be a much better choice because: . It is completely interoperable with Java. You can import your Java code and any other built by anyone within Kotlin. . | Spring Boot and Android officially support Kotlin. . | Kotlin is much more modern than Java offering things like default parameters and null checks. . | . A smaller way to check if Kotlin might be right for you is to migrate or create one microservice in/to Kotlin. . Python 2 to Python 3 . The support for Python 2 ended (2019) after 20 years of development. Its code is frozen and won’t even receive security upgrades. Time to upgrade to Python 3. . Code Reviews . . Benefits of Code Review . Code reviews share knowledge . As code reviews expose developers to new ideas and technologies, they write better and better code. . Nobody wants to dive into a critical piece of code they didn’t write–especially during a production emergency. Code reviews share knowledge across the team so that any team member can take up the reins and continue steering the ship. . Code reviews make for better estimates . Any code reviewer is also exposed to the complexity, known issues, and concerns of that area of the code base . Keep in mind, code review is not just a senior team member reviewing a junior team member’s code. Code review should happen across the team in every direction. Knowledge knows no bounds! Yes, code review can help newer engineers, but by no means should it be used solely as a mentoring exercise. . Source: Why code reviews matter (and actually save time!) .

Kaggle is a platform for data science where you can find competitions, datasets, and other’s solutions. . | Some Kaggle datasets cannot be downloaded directly and can only be downloaded through Kaggle via it’s CLI. . | The Setup (One-time activity) . 1 — Install Kaggle CLI . To get started to Kaggle CLI you will need Python, open terminal and write . $ pip install kaggle . 2 — API credentials . Once you have Kaggle installed, type kaggle to check it is installed and you will get an output similar to this . . In the above line, you will see the path (highlighted) of where to put your kaggle.json file. . To get kaggle.json file go to: . https://www.kaggle.com/&lt;username&gt;/account . In the API section, click Create New API Token. And copy it the path mentioned in the terminal output. . . Type kaggle once again to check. . . In my case, even after copying it was not working. I had the file in place but it did not have the right permissions so I had to type the exact command they gave me. And it started working. . Downloading Dataset via CLI . You can open kaggle help via . kaggle -h . For getting info on competitions you can type . kaggle competitions download -h . whatever the Kaggle CLI command is, add -h to get help. . Find Data . while you can explore Competitions, Datasets, and kernels via Kaggle, here I am going to only focus on downloading of datasets. . What I do is I explore competitions or datasets via Kaggle website. . Download Entire Dataset . To download the dataset, go to Data *subtab. *In API section you will find the exact command that you can copy to the terminal to download the entire dataset. . . . The syntax is like . kaggle competitions download &lt;competition name&gt; . Download Particular File From Dataset . As you can see, the size of the data is 34 GB which is huge. . So instead of downloading entire dataset, you can select which files to download. . You cannot provide download multiple files with a single command (as of 2019/Aug/10) so you will have to download it one by one using the following command. . kaggle competitions download -f &lt;file-name&gt; &lt;competition-name&gt; . . Extract it and start using it. . I usually (plan to) put up a blog post every Saturday and create a YouTube video about it. My next post is a collection of Google Collab tips which will also include a way to download data from Kaggle into collab. .

Split code into multiple cells to get better code-completion . This is a no-brainer but I struggled with this for a long time. . Weakly typed programming languages like Python do not work well with code completions provided by IDEs because the type of value return by a function is defined at run-time. IDEs have a hard time figuring out what the return type is. . .

            "content": ". My rank is 41 out of 441. (0.97 F1 Score). . Before this, I had only practiced 2 lessons from Fast.ai and watched the first 5 lessons. . After the contest, I saw other participant’s approaches and found that their approach was much clearer and cleaner than mine. . Therefore, I decided to complete Fast.ai’s Deep Learning for Coders. . The contest was a month ago from this writing. I had the time to really sit and figure out what went well and what didn’t. . Approach . Here was my approach which I did in stages: . Step 1: Make models . 1. Make a simple resnet50 model. And make sure input and output submission file are correct. . 2. Improve the model. I found that the images were black and old. But the number of images were less and we cannot use external data so my solution was. . Heavy data augmentation (warping, crops, rotations): lead to 5–7 percent increase in F1 score and accuracy. . | Progressive increase image size. . | I initially started with (50,70) images . | Trained it that then increased it. Trained it again. . | . 3. Training approach. . Freeze the model train for 4 epochs | Unfreeze the model train for 7 epochs | I found unfreezing was getting higher accuracy but only when done more than freeze training. 7 is what I stuck at. | I replicated the kernel and trained resnet18, resnet34, vgg16, vgg19 and densenet121 so that I can ensemble there outputs | Model Making Environment: Kaggle Code at Models directory | . Step 2: Max Ensemble . After I had all the outputs from different models. . I used the output CSVs to make a max ensemble. . (You will see that I have renamed file names to be ‘modelname’.csv in ensemble folder and the output file is ‘simple.csv’) . Ensemble making environment: Local . Code: ankschoubey/AnalyticsVidya_Game_Of_Deep_Learning . Lessons and Mistakes Learned . Code . Environment . I trained on Kaggle Kernel. The only way to get output files was to commit. . | I also did not load existing models because on Kaggle you have to attach it as a dataset and then load. It’s a pain so I did not bother. . | It would have been much easier to train on Google Cloud, Collab or Clouderizer. . | . Should have used discriminative learning rate. . Transfer learning without discriminative learning rate is stupid. | . Refactor code early before replicating the kernel . I replicated kernels so that I can train different models on different kernels and get results faster. . | The problem was that I had introduced a bug which got replicated. Also, making changes was a pain because I had to copy paste things multiple times. . | . Use metrics used in the contest . Kind of dumb to mention this: I did not use the F1 score. Rather relied on accuracy. . Save as many things as I can so that you save time later . Save results . | Save model . | Save data . | . Use Checkpoints . Did forget the idea of checkpoints entirely. | . Useless Model . I made an ensemble which sucked because it only lead to 0.05 percent improvement. . | The reason was I used a lot of mediocre models. . | 1 ResNet 34/50 would have been fine. . | Also did not know about DenseNet very well back then. . | I believe that an ensemble of ResNet and DenseNet would have been wonderful. . | . Data . Look at the data and use good augmentation . I saw some images were grey scale and old. I might have got a higher score if I had taken time | . . Using good data augmentation. . My model was not performing well. 93–94% accuracy was the limit. . I buffed up every transformation. And it started reaching 96+. Warping helped a lot. . . Developer Habits . Start submissions early in the contest. And complete your work at least 3–4 days before the end. | .",
