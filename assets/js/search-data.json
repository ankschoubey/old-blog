A non-technical person does not know the problem that can be solved using technology. . A technical person does not know what problems to solve. The result is that time is solved solving problems on trivial issues like social media instead of more important fields. . How other fields can benefit . Some fields have slow progress rate. There is a long delay in medical research getting to production (Approx 20 year 1). There hasn’t been much innovation in the field even in engineering fields like Civil engineer or biotechnology. . The reason is likely because these fields require physical products and take longer to build and test. A technology solution can help speed up some of their processes. . Graphics Modelling and Simulations to speed to testing | Data Organization and Retrieval Systems to make sure the right information is accessed. | Deep Learning Models to help search for replacing overdependence of specialized hardware. | Automation of manual tasks | .

Earlier, I was avoiding the cloud because it seemed very hard. But like every computer science buzzword, it is much much easier than expected. . Recently I started learning AWS. These are a few things that have changed my mind. . Cost: Pay only for what you use . Cloud is anyway cheaper than building and maintaining your server. . The cost can be optimized further by setting up things properly. . Cost is impacted by decisions such as: . Pay per minute | Different cost for different configuration | Pay per GB of data stored | . And cloud vendors themselves provide options and encourage customers to optimize their usage to reduce cost. . Rapid Availability . Resources are available to you the instant you want them and in the location, you want them at. . If I were to start a Deep Learning project, on my local machine, it would take a full workday to just set things upright. Plus, you’ll have to deal with upgrades and maintenance yourself. . The same thing I wanted to do on AWS, it took just 3 minutes. . Special Hardware . In fields like Machine Learning, you need high computation and specialized hardware. . A cloud provider can provide it instantly. . Similarly, Quantum Programming is a new field for programmers that were not available to most developers. But cloud providers are providing infrastructure for this new field. . Choice: “We’ll provide infrastructure. Your code!” . Traditionally, if you buy hardware and it is not used, you cannot do much other than selling the hardware to reclaim the cost. . Cloud solves this problem by allowing users to change their underlying infrastructure at any moment. . Maintainance: “We’ll provide support. You code!” . Small things like replication of the servers and databases, scaling, sharding, maintaining security, etc are automatically taken care of with a few clicks. . Cloud vendors provide a good set of defaults and out of the box solutions to these common problems. . Abstraction: Easier than Traditional Setup . Cloud vendors make it easier to use the cloud. Things are abstracted and one can choose to learn until what is required. . Most normal developers would not have to deal with specifics of the infrastructure. . Special APIs: Code less . Almost all cloud providers provide special APIs for things like text recognition, image recognition, and even blockchains. . One need not be an expert to use these out of the box solutions. . Conclusion: Cloud is a Win-Win . Cloud provides a lot of consumer surplus. . Cloud is such that the price of owning and maintaining for the individual user than if they would have built a server themselves. . While for the cloud provider, it is also cheap because they provide it at scale. . Not to mentions, they are easier to use and provide the flexibility of choice. .",

Learn it right there and there. If you don’t you are just approximating what the author says. . If you are going to read a series of 📚 then learn each new word. The same word will be used later. . Selecting books to read . Reading from different categories is an easy way to broaden your perspective. . Always be reading at least 2 books, fiction, and non-fiction. . Non-fiction: Make your more informed and put things into action. | Fiction: Makes you less boring and counteracts the overthinking created by non-fiction. | . Don’t buy non-fiction books that have just been released. Let the reviews come in. . If the right book is selected, it is worth paying the price. . Reasoning . Don’t agree with everything you read. Authors are humans too. 2 . Put yourself in the shoes of the author and try to reason through his conclusions. . You want to internalize the author’s thinking so that you can see the problem from his point of view. 1 . Reading books which provide a counter-argument to your thought or to a book you have read is also interesting. . Speed Reading . If you are speed reading, it is probably not worth reading. 1 . Reading speed increases naturally as you get into a habit of reading regularly. . Naval &#8617; &#8617;2 &#8617;3 . | James Clear &#8617; . |",

A few changes happened between 2013 to 2020 (now) that seem to have effected this notion. . Competition and Similar Content . The amount of people uploading and watching “content” has exploded. . If a few years ago the same content would have less competition. But now not just the content has to compete with other similar content but also over factors like freshness. . Reducing attention span . Personalized Recommendation Engines . Bigger companies saw value in the shift in attention towards online sources and exploding data. . Since the amount of data has increased, the recommendation algorithms designed to keep people engage and make advertisers happy are getting more and choosy. . Personalized Search Engines . A few years go personalize results only appeared for feeds, now appear in normal search results too. This means that everyone who searches for something gets different results. . But this also means that you are more likely to target your specific demographic as the algorithm thinks it is the right fit. . These all lead to change in SEO strategy . The basic search engine optimization (SEO) methods like keyword optimization and backlinking no longer work as well as effectively as they used to. These methods were more or less automatic and easy for people to make their websites reach people easily. . The newer methods which work along with are basic SEO strategies are more analog. A person has to decide how to come up with these: . Site-specific strategies like Thumbnail and Timestamp on Youtube, | Creating a ‘brand’ account and promoting | Engaging and trying to retain users with witty and regular posts/stories | . Conclusion . The newer methods of engagement are more work than what they were a few years ago. . At the same time, the result of these efforts is more shorten as the same strategy is applied by every other content generator. .

I hate learning “new” languages/framework/technology especially when . it does the exact same thing that I can do now | does not add any new benefit | it’s old/outdated | if I’ll likely never use it | proprietary technology | . So, . no AngularJS after learning Angular. | nothing less than Spring Boot when doing Java. | Typescript &gt; Javascript. | PyTorch is probably enough. Don’t need Tensorflow. | SQL is enough. No need of NoSQL yet. | . Exceptions . There have always existed exceptions and cases where I just needed to learn something. . Old but need it: Had to learn excel to reverse engineering and build same feature in Spring Boot | Learning a good framework: Had learned Django before. After joining worked I learned Spring Boot and realized it much better. | Made life easy: My application UI was crap. Easiest way was to learn CSS myself without using Bootstrap. It was easier than I expected. Thanks Fireship. | For Future: I may learn a little Firebase just to see how fast I can develop applications in it. Hopefully transferring some of that knowledge to my daily coding. | . But most exceptions occur where I either had to do it or see a benefit that is transferrable to what I do. . . I try not to learn something just to add to resume or to list of things that just sound cool (sometimes I do). . I usually spend months deciding. . YouTube videos and written articles have been great help when deciding. .",

Read the data . train_df = pd.read_csv(&#39;/kaggle/input/digit-recognizer/train.csv&#39;) . Training/testing . I needed a way to separate features and labels. . So the easiest way was to not select a column named ‘label’. . test_df does not contain a label column . train_df.loc[:, train_df.columns != &#39;label&#39;] type(test_df.get(&#39;label&#39;)) == None #false .

Observation: Even if I don’t explicitly mention Tensor, NumPy is converted to tensor. . Creating DataLoader . bs = 64 ds = MnistDataset(train_df) dl = DataLoader(ds, bs) . Checking if DataLoader returns the right output . images, labels = next(iter(dl)) images.shape, labels.shape . Creating a vanilla Neural Network .

Commit Version 3: Improvements . Changes: Proper Accuracy, Graph, and Data Normalization . Day 4 . | Score — 0.96 . | Time invested — about an hour . | . Proper Accuracy . Accuracy should always be calculated on the validation set. . Creating a separate validation set . val_len = int(len(ds)*0.01) # 0.01 percent of data train_len = len(ds) — val_len # all other are in training from torch.utils.data import random_split train_ds, val_ds = random_split(ds, [train_len, val_len]) . Likewise, 2 data loaders are created. . bs = 64 train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, bs) val_dl = DataLoader(val_ds, bs) . Changes in the training loop . A separate list called accuracies in created to store the accuracy of an epoch. . ... with torch.no_grad(): accuracy = 0 for images, labels in val_dl: out = net(images.float()) accuracy+=(out.argmax(dim=1) == labels).sum().item() accuracies.append(accuracy/len(val_ds) * 100) . Graph . Since the accuracy of each epoch was stored in a separate accuracies list, creating a graph was easy. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot(range(epochs), accuracies) . Data Normalization . After plotting the graph, I realized accuracy was 43% which is the same as the score of commit 2. . The easiest thing to do was to normalize the data. . Since MNIST images are in the range of 1…250 the easiest thing to do was to divide by 250 which would result in a range of 0…1. . Ideally, the range should be around 0 so an even better approach would be . image = image/250–0.5 . this would result in a range between -0.5…+0.5. . Later we would use torchvision.transforms.Normalize(mean, std, inplace=False) which generates unique normalization value for each dataset . Commit 6: ConvNet, and GPU . Day 6 . | Score — 0.97 . | Time invested — about 2 hours (lots of googling and reading docs) + 1 hours fixes bugs . | . ConvNet . Convolutional Neural Networks are ideal images. . ResNet . ResNet 34 is my goto ConvNet but since MNIST is so easy, I went with ResNet 18. . import torchvision.models as models resnet18 = models.resnet18(pretrained=True) resnet18.fc #print fully connected network . ResNet is designed to output 1000 classes. But our output is from 0…9 aka 10 classes. . lin_in = resnet18.fc.in_features import torch.nn as nn resnet18.fc = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(lin_in, 10), nn.Softmax(dim=1) ) . Convert Grayscale to RGB image . ResNet expects RGB images. MNIST is grayscale. . img = img.view(3, 28, 28).expand(3, 28, 28)` . This grayscale to the RGB line is added to our Dataset class. . Normalization . When using an existing model, we need to use the same normalization values as that model. The docs mention the normalization value. . import torchvision.transforms as transforms normalize = transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) . The init and getitem dataset class have been modified to use this transformation. . Modifications have also been made to test_ds. . GPU . One I started the training loop, I realized it suddenly became too slow. . GPU is needed! . device = torch.device(&#39;cuda:0&#39;) if torch.cuda.is_available() else &#39;cpu&#39; . If the GPU is on, the device will be cuda. . The neural network and the data in training, validation and texting loop have been changed to run on GPU. . net = net.to(device) ... images, labels = images.to(device,dtype=torch.float), labels.to(device) . And since we are on GPU we can increase our batch size from 64 to much higher. . I experimented with a few sizes from 320…640 and kept an eye on GPU utilization and settled for 512. . . I did the same for num_worker which specifies the number of threads to load a batch. This is CPU stuff. . Along with monitoring GPU and CPU usage, I modified training_loop to show the amount of time taken to complete each epoch. . bs = 512 num_workers = 2 train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, bs, num_workers=num_workers) val_dl = DataLoader(val_ds, bs, num_workers=num_workers) . This resulted in 7 seconds per epoch. . For testing, the batch_size can be much higher since we don’t have to back prop. . Commit 7: Improvement . Day 8 . | Score — 0.97 . | Time invested — about 30 minutes . | . I learned that you don’t need nn.Softmax if you are using nn.CrossEntropyLoss. . nn.CrossEntropyLoss has nn.Softmax built-in and the results of softmax are not used during back-prop. So it can be safely removed. . Now FC is this: . lin_in = resnet18.fc.in_features import torch.nn as nn resnet18.fc = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(lin_in, 10) ) . .

Choosing a programming language is a hard process. . Ideally, you would want to choose something which is: . Non-proprietary . | In-expensive or FREE . | Easy to code in . | Flexible enough . | . Java to Kotlin . Enterprises seem to have got stuck with Java 8 (released in 2017) because it is free. The newer versions of Java offer much better and easy to use features but enterprises won’t upgrade. . Kotlin might be a much better choice because: . It is completely interoperable with Java. You can import your Java code and any other built by anyone within Kotlin. . | Spring Boot and Android officially support Kotlin. . | Kotlin is much more modern than Java offering things like default parameters and null checks. . | . A smaller way to check if Kotlin might be right for you is to migrate or create one microservice in/to Kotlin. . Python 2 to Python 3 . The support for Python 2 ended (2019) after 20 years of development. Its code is frozen and won’t even receive security upgrades. Time to upgrade to Python 3. . Code Reviews . . Benefits of Code Review . Code reviews share knowledge . As code reviews expose developers to new ideas and technologies, they write better and better code. . Nobody wants to dive into a critical piece of code they didn’t write–especially during a production emergency. Code reviews share knowledge across the team so that any team member can take up the reins and continue steering the ship. . Code reviews make for better estimates . Any code reviewer is also exposed to the complexity, known issues, and concerns of that area of the code base . Keep in mind, code review is not just a senior team member reviewing a junior team member’s code. Code review should happen across the team in every direction. Knowledge knows no bounds! Yes, code review can help newer engineers, but by no means should it be used solely as a mentoring exercise. . Source: Why code reviews matter (and actually save time!) . The article also mentions ways to make code reviews much more productive. . When done right, code reviews actually save time in the long run. .

Your exceptions should say exactly what went wrong. While those provided by programming languages are good, they are too general and are not specific to your codebase. . Oversimplified example: . Bad: Exception(“number is smaller than 0”) . | Better: SpeedException(“Speed should not be smaller than 0”) . | . The reason you want to do this is that you can handle different types of exceptions in different ways and it is much easy to know exactly what went wrong from the logs. . In most programming languages creating exception is easy. Just inherit from the main Exception class which should be enough for most cases. . Custom Exception class also makes your logs easier to read. . Always know why you are catching an exception… . . … or just don’t catch it (throws to the caller) . if you are not going to do anything with the exception don’t catch it just throw it. . Don’t add throw exception in the catch block. Use throws while declaring the function instead. . For Unsupported Operations . In if-else statements or switch cases, it is always good to have a default case which will execute if no other condition is true. . If something is not possible or not supported then: . throw (Java): UnsupportedOperationException . | raise (Python): NotImplementedError . | . . Global exception handling .

HyperDash allows you to monitor your model training or anything that is printed via your phone. It supports both iOS and Android and is super simple to get setup. . Installation Step: . Install HyperDash on your phone | . Go to your Jupyter notebook and run the below cell | I used GitHub login so I added -github in the end . pip install hyperdash &amp;&amp; hyperdash login — github . Import module | from hyperdash import monitor_cell . Use this magic in the cell you want to monitor. Which for most will be the training loop. | %%monitor_cell “model/experiment name” . In the app, you can see something like this. While I have included this as a tip, it is not something I have used. Because I have never trained for a very long duration. . . As per HyperDash website, it also allows detection of the status of your training and can notify when your training completes, fails, crashes or gets disconnected. . 9. 10. — Random Filler Tips: Dark Mode and Corgi/Kitti Mode .

Kaggle is a platform for data science where you can find competitions, datasets, and other’s solutions. . | Some Kaggle datasets cannot be downloaded directly and can only be downloaded through Kaggle via it’s CLI. . | The Setup (One-time activity) . 1 — Install Kaggle CLI . To get started to Kaggle CLI you will need Python, open terminal and write . $ pip install kaggle . 2 — API credentials . Once you have Kaggle installed, type kaggle to check it is installed and you will get an output similar to this . . In the above line, you will see the path (highlighted) of where to put your kaggle.json file. . To get kaggle.json file go to: . https://www.kaggle.com/&lt;username&gt;/account . In the API section, click Create New API Token. And copy it the path mentioned in the terminal output. . . Type kaggle once again to check. . . In my case, even after copying it was not working. I had the file in place but it did not have the right permissions so I had to type the exact command they gave me. And it started working. . Downloading Dataset via CLI . You can open kaggle help via . kaggle -h . For getting info on competitions you can type . kaggle competitions download -h . whatever the Kaggle CLI command is, add -h to get help. . Find Data . while you can explore Competitions, Datasets, and kernels via Kaggle, here I am going to only focus on downloading of datasets. . What I do is I explore competitions or datasets via Kaggle website. . Download Entire Dataset . To download the dataset, go to Data *subtab. *In API section you will find the exact command that you can copy to the terminal to download the entire dataset. . . . The syntax is like . kaggle competitions download &lt;competition name&gt; . Download Particular File From Dataset . As you can see, the size of the data is 34 GB which is huge. . So instead of downloading entire dataset, you can select which files to download. . You cannot provide download multiple files with a single command (as of 2019/Aug/10) so you will have to download it one by one using the following command. . kaggle competitions download -f &lt;file-name&gt; &lt;competition-name&gt; . . Extract it and start using it. . I usually (plan to) put up a blog post every Saturday and create a YouTube video about it. My next post is a collection of Google Collab tips which will also include a way to download data from Kaggle into collab. .

In Jupyter Notebook where you want to be able to quickly interactively try stuff out, you don’t want to constantly going back up to the top and importing more stuff. You want to be able to use lots of tab complete and be very experimental, so import * is great. . When you are building stuff in production, you can do the normal PEP8 style proper software engineering practices. . This is a different style of coding. It’s not that there are no rules in data science programming, the rules are different. . ~ Jeremy Howard (Source: FastAI v3 Lesson 1) . Types of Notebooks . It is best to consider 2 types of notebooks for your projects . Lab Notebooks . | Delivery Notebooks . | Lab Notebooks help in trying stuff out without worrying about making things every reproducible. The goal is just to refer back to what was done in the past. .

Split code into multiple cells to get better code-completion . This is a no-brainer but I struggled with this for a long time. . Weakly typed programming languages like Python do not work well with code completions provided by IDEs because the type of value return by a function is defined at run-time. IDEs have a hard time figuring out what the return type is. . . But when running Jupyter Notebook you can avoid this by splitting your code into multiple cells instead of one, running them one by one and then hitting Tab. . .

            "content": ". My rank is 41 out of 441. (0.97 F1 Score). . Before this, I had only practiced 2 lessons from Fast.ai and watched the first 5 lessons. . After the contest, I saw other participant’s approaches and found that their approach was much clearer and cleaner than mine. . Therefore, I decided to complete Fast.ai’s Deep Learning for Coders. . The contest was a month ago from this writing. I had the time to really sit and figure out what went well and what didn’t. . Approach . Here was my approach which I did in stages: . Step 1: Make models . 1. Make a simple resnet50 model. And make sure input and output submission file are correct. . 2. Improve the model. I found that the images were black and old. But the number of images were less and we cannot use external data so my solution was. . Heavy data augmentation (warping, crops, rotations): lead to 5–7 percent increase in F1 score and accuracy. . | Progressive increase image size. . | I initially started with (50,70) images . | Trained it that then increased it. Trained it again. . | . 3. Training approach. . Freeze the model train for 4 epochs | Unfreeze the model train for 7 epochs | I found unfreezing was getting higher accuracy but only when done more than freeze training. 7 is what I stuck at. | I replicated the kernel and trained resnet18, resnet34, vgg16, vgg19 and densenet121 so that I can ensemble there outputs | Model Making Environment: Kaggle Code at Models directory | . Step 2: Max Ensemble . After I had all the outputs from different models. . I used the output CSVs to make a max ensemble. . (You will see that I have renamed file names to be ‘modelname’.csv in ensemble folder and the output file is ‘simple.csv’) . Ensemble making environment: Local . Code: ankschoubey/AnalyticsVidya_Game_Of_Deep_Learning . Lessons and Mistakes Learned . Code . Environment . I trained on Kaggle Kernel. The only way to get output files was to commit. . | I also did not load existing models because on Kaggle you have to attach it as a dataset and then load. It’s a pain so I did not bother. . | It would have been much easier to train on Google Cloud, Collab or Clouderizer. . | . Should have used discriminative learning rate. . Transfer learning without discriminative learning rate is stupid. | . Refactor code early before replicating the kernel . I replicated kernels so that I can train different models on different kernels and get results faster. . | The problem was that I had introduced a bug which got replicated. Also, making changes was a pain because I had to copy paste things multiple times. . | . Use metrics used in the contest . Kind of dumb to mention this: I did not use the F1 score. Rather relied on accuracy. . Save as many things as I can so that you save time later . Save results . | Save model . | Save data . | . Use Checkpoints . Did forget the idea of checkpoints entirely. | . Useless Model . I made an ensemble which sucked because it only lead to 0.05 percent improvement. . | The reason was I used a lot of mediocre models. . | 1 ResNet 34/50 would have been fine. . | Also did not know about DenseNet very well back then. . | I believe that an ensemble of ResNet and DenseNet would have been wonderful. . | . Data . Look at the data and use good augmentation . I saw some images were grey scale and old. I might have got a higher score if I had taken time | . . Using good data augmentation. . My model was not performing well. 93–94% accuracy was the limit. . I buffed up every transformation. And it started reaching 96+. Warping helped a lot. . . Developer Habits . Start submissions early in the contest. And complete your work at least 3–4 days before the end. | .",
