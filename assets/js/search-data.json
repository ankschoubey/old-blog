What I have developed is a plugin architecture which is robust enough. There are too many points to the discussion. These are all my thoughts. . Identify places in your application which you want to provide as plugin . . Identify how plugin is going to share data? And can plugin update in real time? if Yes how? . . For example: 1 Plugin can be of 2 parts. . How will P1 and P2 share data? . Ideally, these should be microservices? . Note: This is how slack and teams do it. . Define interfaces that plugin developers can use . Zapier allows using CLI to generate a project architecture | They have specific interfaces that can be used for generating plugin | They also have a z object that can be used for a limited set of features such as API calls. | . Keep your product as lean as possible . For plugin architecture, the whole product should be made pluggable. That is even first party features should be developed as plugin. Which means there will be almost nothing in the core. . You could have 2 interfaces for this. . 1 for publish pluginInterface 2 for first hand interface firstHand extends pluginInterface . Or you could provide a limited set of components that can be rendered on UI. . The term interface and components are loose here. Many plugins are simply JSON based. . You’ll have to create infrastructure for managing plugins and plugin lifecycle . Something like . Interfaces for plugins | Plugin repository How will you manage so many third party plugins? | How will plugin versions be managed? | . | Approval process This will also include manual approavls. | I would also add a virus scanner and other security measures. | . | . Resources . Plugin Development for Wordpress: They are much more low-level about implementation. Especially go through their best practices section. . Plugin Architecture: Why and How?: Goes into detail about why to implement plugin architecture. How is plugin architecture better than monoliths? How are predefined hooks used in plugin architecture?

What is Application Development? . You can be an application developer, which means you’ll solve problems related to a particular domain. . You’ll have to talk to domain experts. And your customers would likely be business users. . The skills needed here are: . Understanding the domain. | Designing solutions for the domain. | Regular interaction with domain experts. | . Application development is where code solves real-world problems. . Inventing the previous line: The main challenge is translating domain to code. . Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Domain Specific Languages are concepts that help bridge the gap between domain experts and developers. . Domain Developers need to be product-minded, i.e. they should be able to suggest improvements because they know what’s possible and what is not. . Also, they should be able to know the nuances of the domain. . What is Framework Development? . These are developers that make the tools used by domain developers. These can be - IDE, Libraries, Frameworks, Microservice Chassis, DevOps and platform development. . At a high level, this can be something like Spring Boot framework, Kubernetes platform, developers who build AWS, Java language, PyTorch and inventing Algorithms. . At a company level, there is always a standard code and microservice chassis that can be abstracted away to make everyone else’s code lighter. . Why Framework Development Is Biggest Software Development Baton? . Framework developers abstract away things so that domain/application developers have less to learn. . What framework developers do applies to every domain. . The impact that framework developers have is much bigger than any domain developer. . For example, Spring Native speeds up load time for spring boot applications from 2.8 seconds to .3 seconds. Every developer can adopt a huge performance difference just by adding a maven package. . Similarly: an algorithm like Dikshtra’s Shortest Path has had a much more significant impact than the work of most application developers. . Domain problems lead to the need for new algorithms, which eventually becomes part of a framework when it gets abstracted. . Frameworks like Spring Boot, Platforms like Kubernetes and Cloud Provides like AWS have had a much higher impact than any individual. . Resources .

If the browser receives a 302 temporary redirect, it’ll redirect to the location specified by the server. . Not all status codes are directly browser compatible. You can find the list of compatible ones here. . HTTP Status Codes are also helpful when you are building a client yourself. . For example: For the retry mechanism, you might retry a few times if there is a 5xx Server Error but might not retry if it’s a 4xx client error . Types . There are a total of 63 status codes that are grouped into 5 types: . 1xx → Info | 2xx → Successful | 3xx → Some redirect | 4xx → Client error: The sender has made some mistake and has to fix it. | 5xx → Server error: The server has made some mistake and has to fix it. | . Specific Codes . Now, when coding, you are likely to use these. But if you find another one, google it, and you’ll find the reason behind it. . 200 → OK | 201 → The server CREATED the resource. The location header includes the location of the resource. | 204 → NO CONTENT, but there is No Content . | 302 → REDIRECT to this URL . | 400 -&gt; BAD REQUEST | 401 → UNAUTHORIZED: The client isn’t authorized and needs to send valid auth credentials. | 404 → NOT FOUND: The resource isn’t available . | 500 → INTERNAL SERVER ERROR Restrict the response because it may reveal the inner workings of the server. | . | . Notes . People often don’t rely on HTTP status codes but instead, use the body to convey information. This approach is especially true in the case of specialized responses since there are very few HTTP status codes. . When to use 404 over 204? .

There are many ways to categorize personality. A few I know are: . Myers Briggs Personality Assement | Big 5 | Dark Triad | Type A and Type B | This post is going to talk about Type A and Type B. There are style of work related classifications. . What is Type A? . Type A personality is the one that works hard non-stop. They are well organized and can get high amount of productivity done is a really short time. . But Type A works at its best only in a controlled environment. They are control freaks. If the environment is not under control. They will not just work badly but get demotivated. This further creates a loop of reasons for bad work. At its worst, their tendency to be way too perfectionistic backfires. Perfectionism can make people hard to get started. . The real world is rarely well structured and controlled. Everything is random and some things happen for random reasons. In this environment, the one who thrives should be able to adapt to different circumstances. Learn skills and move forward. . What is Type B? . Type Bs are laid back. There are the ones that are late and still believe they can get everything done. This chill relaxes but get things done. . They aren’t perfectionistic. When they produce work, what they produce might be — for lack of a better work — tatti. And therefore they might produce a lot of debt while they work. This means they have to come back and rework. . The good thing is they have a very very high output. That output comprises of multiple small simple things. . Type B are highly adaptable. They learn quickly. Not perfectly but quickly. . Why should one aim to be between Type A and Type B? . Before answering the question, let’s see how Type A and B compare: . Type A: Bad in real world because they look for a controlled environment. Type B: Good in real world because they are much more agile. . Type A: Produce good quality work that doesn’t need rework. Type B: Produce low quality work that often needs rework. . Type A: Produces less overall quantity of work Type B: Produces more overall quality of work. . As we can see, it seems Type A balance Type B and vice a versa. While it’s perfectly nice to have an interdependent relationship with the other type, often many of our journeys are alone. . We ourselves need to keep the balance between producing high-quality work and getting many things done, all while still not having to go back and rework and still adapt to a changing environment. . This may be hard to imagine so here are a few real-life examples from me, a largely Type A as of 2022 Oct 02. . I love high-quality code. And whenever I join a project, it’s very hard at first but as days go on and the coding standards reach a level of perfection, it’s hard for me to leave the project. Developers around me have already started to talk about new technologies or features they are building, but I am still stuck in the past. Looking at that perfect code. And at the same time, I don’t even know what I can improve in that code base now that I feel I am already perfect. . Whenever I jump to a new project, I have the same expectation of high productivity and quality from day one. This demotivates me and makes me go slower than I would like. But as days go by, this project also reaches a good perfect state. When I revisit the previous one, I find improvements I could do there which I learned from this one. I wouldn’t have ever understood that if I hadn’t made the jump. #grateful . How does this relate to the concept of order and chaos? . Type A: Order Type B: Chaos . This comes from Jordan Peterson’s books. The books describe how to stay between Order and Chaos, the two modes where you feel safe and still excited for new possibilities. . How can one stay between Type A and Type B? . I can’t answer for Type B. But for Type A it’s giving up on control. You’ll anyway try to produce high quality. Produce a lot and you’ll find the quality improves over time. . Think like Kanban, pick a task, and move it to completion. Then pick a new task. Aka one task at a time till completion. That should boost your productivity incredible. . Adapt to environments, you may need to learn and face your comfort zones. That’s okay. Think of this in terms of expanding your comfort zone rather than face. The face is such a loaded term. . Reading -&gt; Learning -&gt; Applying is the fastest way to improve quality. . And chill, relax. Nature is random and it’s still perfect :) or else we wouldn’t have been here. .",

            "content": ". . Note: For beginners: Design patterns are template solutions to common problems developers face. There are many design patterns; the best known are the 2 Gang of Four (GoF) object-oriented design patterns. Testing interfaces, abstract classes, and design patterns efficiently can be tricky since parents and children depend on each other. We can write tests to eliminate these dependencies during the test time, making our tests very short and decoupled. . But first, why should you even use abstract classes and design patterns? . Why should we use interfaces, abstract classes and design patterns? . Good code should enforce the intent of how it is to be used. . Ideally, we strive for a SOLID design: A code with a single responsibility that cannot be changed but is extensible. Interfaces and abstract classes help us achieve this goal. . Suppose your systems represent different vehicles. Instead of having separate logic for each, you can represent the common logic in a ‘Vehicle’ class and have its behaviour implemented and modified by the subclasses. . abstract class Vehicle{ void travelTo(Point destination){ // common logic to move a vehicle that uses this.getHorn() } abstract Horn getHorn(); // this will be implemented by children } class Tesla extends Vehicle{ Horn getHorn(){ return new Horn(&quot;John Cena: You can&#39;t see me&quot;); } } . The above code corresponds to the factory method design pattern. . All 24 object-oriented GoF design patterns also embody SOLID principles. Developers should prefer these patterns as they help our code be very clean. . How should we unit test them? . Unit testing a pattern can be tricky since things are so abstract. . Testing all the concrete and parent classes together will make our tests very dependent on the parent and will be hard to maintain. . The trick here is to test both separately. . Testing abstract class . make a dummy concrete implementation within the test class. . // this is a test file for the abstract class // 1. Make a Dummy implementation of the abstract class/interface within the test class DummyVehicleImpl extends Vehicle{ Horn getHorn(){ return new Horn(&quot;THIS IS DUMMY BUT IT CAN SING FROZEN&quot;); } } // 2. Create the instance of a dummy Vehicle vehicle = new DummyVehicleImpl(); // 3. Use the dummy implementation to assert the parent. . The steps to test composition is also similar. . Testing children . In the above section, we tested parents. Now we can test the child. . Each child will have a separate test class that tests its method, excluding the parent’s methods. . class TeslaTests{ Tesla tesla = new Tesla(); // code which tests methods of tesla class and not the parent. } . . What do you think about this approach? Is there a better approach to testing abstract classes and design patterns? Do let me know what you think. . Thank you for reading so far. .",

Immutability is the intent of the creator of the object/class, i.e. when coding something up, we need to decide if a particular class should be immutable. Also, immutability is as important in the front end as in the back end. While the below posts explain it in Java, other programming languages have their way of implementing immutability. Where Immutability is needed? . When sharing data between threads, there is a high chance that one memory gets replaced by another. This would lead to inconsistency, and often these bugs aren’t discovered. . There are two ways to avoid this: thread-safe data structures or immutable objects. . This particular post will explain where immutable objects are necessary. . Suppose you have 2 Rest Endpoints. /someEndpoint and /anotherEndpoint both set a particular value to the variable sharedMemory. . private String sharedMemory; @PostMapping(&quot;/someEndpoint&quot;) void postSomething(@RequestBody String value){ sharedMemory = value; .... //some code that uses sharedMemory } @PostMapping(&quot;/anotherEndpoint&quot;) void postSomethingElse(@RequestBody String value){ sharedMemory = value; .... //some code that uses sharedMemory } . It can happen that this shared memory is not inconsistent. . Ideally, the solution would be, in this case, to declare the variable within the method it is used. . Creating an immutable object . The creation of immutable objects is relatively simple. . Make sure all instance variables are private final. | make sure all interactions with the method happens only via the constructor or the public method. No method should modify the contents of the private final method. | Make sure all instance variables are immutable. | Make sure the class is final so that there is no inheriting and subclasses can’t override something. | There are some more rules, but these are the minimum requirements. The following section will explain how you automate the checking of immutable classes would also check for more conditions. . Java Libraries . Some libraries help create immutable objects, such as Immutables for Java. . Google Guava Library provides many immutable data structure alternatives. The benefit of using these is that they have the same interface as regular java collections. . . Note: It&#39;s best to start with immutable objects and then modify them if needed. Automating Verification via Unit Tests . But when developing within a team and given the cognitive overload we developers face, we need some way to automate the creation of immutable objects. This can be done as a combo of 2 methods: . #1 Mutability Detector . Mutability Detector is a package that provides the following assertion that can be used within unit tests. . Mutability Detector has many more conditions to detect mutability. . assertImmutable(MyClass.class); . Github Source . #2 Automate further with ArchUnit tests . ArchUnit tests allow for writing architecture-level tests. We can write a test such as asserting that a class is immutable if a class is annotated with @component. . . In practice, I couldn’t fully make assertImmutable work with abstract classes. . Resources .

            "content": ". Photo by Isaac Li Shung Tan on Unsplash . What are feature flags? . The concept of feature flags is simple. You can toggle a feature on or off based on certain conditions. And ideally, this requires zero downtime. . For example, an experiment feature can be turned on for some users but disabled for others. . There are many levels to feature flagging: . Disable feature for specific users | Disable the feature completely | Disable the feature in case of certain conditions | . Feature flagging can also help in AB Testing. . Feature Flagging for CD . Feature flags also help in CD. Rather than feature branching, everyone can work on a single branch, but the features that aren’t ready yet can be disabled on prod. This decouples release and feature. Feature flagging is probabilistic because, in practice, it leads to stale branches. . In case of chaos engineering, a feature flag can help reduce blast radius and improve resiliency. Suppose a feature fails; that feature can be disabled at a run time until fixed. . Common ways of implementing Feature Flagging . Storing flags . The simplest implementation of the feature flag is DB based. A list of features is stored along with a flag to enable or disable it. Each time a decision comes, DB is called to fetch the flag’s status. . Environment variables can also be used. Configuration management systems like Spring Cloud Config can also be used to store flags. . Enabling disabling . The code has an IF else statement that enables or disables the feature. . An even better approach to IF else is dependency injection. If a class can be instantiated conditionally, then we solved the feature flagging problem cleanly. . Having a class per feature and inheriting a common interface is the best approach here. In the planning features section of this blog post, you’ll find more ideas on how to reach this. . End-to-end services . There are also full-blown services that help with feature flagging, like LaunchDarkly and FlagShip . Resources .

But still, while we do TDD, there are times when we still can’t predict real-world scenarios. . For example: If we have a String coming from the external system, it can be null. . We can have a repository of known issues and remember them. A form of threat-modelling/chaos engineering for logic. It’s also helpful to offload such a task to an automated test. That test is mutation testing. . What is mutation testing? . Assuming you wrote a test for a piece of code passes. If there are changes to the code, the test should fail. . That is what mutation testing does. Mutation testing mutates (modifies) the code and checks if tests fail. If the test passes, then we know the test isn’t accurate. . Tests not being accurate can mean two things: . Either the scenario isn’t covered. | Or assertion isn’t accurate enough. | . In both cases, once we have uncovered a mutant, we can update our test and code to handle the situation. . Mutation testing improves both code and tests. . How accurate is mutation testing? . Sometimes mutation testing produces garbage responses. Like when a mutant removes a log line. . Similarly, for specific autogenerated codes, we don’t need mutations. . Sometimes it’s just garbage. But sometimes, it does uncover accurate details. . The accuracy of mutation testing depends on the application, selected mutants, and current test quality. . If the application is simple like CRUD, mutation tests might not uncover anything. . If the types of mutants selected don’t fit your particular application, then mutations might not uncover anything. . Mutation tests may not discover anything useful if your test quality is already high. But that’s the point. Right? A fallback safety might discover things early in the SDLC process. .

Code coverage can be high even without any assertion. Mutation coverage cannot be high if there are no assertions. . Mutation coverage depends on code coverage. If a code isn’t reachable, mutating that code will not affect the test. . So aim for high code coverage. .

Apart from this, maven also helps in testing, and release and has a plugin ecosystem to automate many tasks. Updating dependencies is important.

You have chosen Spring Webflux for the backend and Angular for the frontend since both provide reactive programming support. Webflux provides it with Project Reactor. Angular provides it with RxJs. . A non-reactive non-streaming way would have been something like this . Create an API endpoint that fetches all movies from the database to the backend service. 2 Once all the data is fetched, then create a payload to send to the browser. (Backend has to wait for fetching to be complete) | Once the complete payload is received by the browser, it will start rendering the details. (Browser has to wait for fetching to be complete) | Spring Webflux backend: . return moviesRepository.findAll() .collectList() // this makes it non-streaming .flatMap(movies-&gt; ServerResponse.ok().bodyValue(movies)); . Angular Frontend: . Typescript: . this.httpClient.get(&quot;/movies&quot;) .subscribe( // this line makes it non-streaming movies=&gt; this.movies = movies; ); . HTML: . &lt;li *ngFor=&quot;let movie of movies&quot;&gt; { { movie.name }} &lt;/li&gt; . A reactive streaming implementation would be like this: . Start fetching movies from the database to the backend. | As movies are being fetched, start creating the payload and send that payload to the browser without waiting for other movies. (Backend does not wait for fetching to be complete) | Browser will receive a record and display it. When it receives another record, it will display that as well. (Browser does not have to wait for fetching to be complete). | This means that both your backend and your frontend have to be reactive-streaming. . Spring Webflux backend: . return ServerResponse.ok().body(moviesRepository.findAll(), Movies.class); . Angular Frontend: . Typescript: . this.movies = this.httpClient.get(&quot;/movies&quot;); . HTML: . &lt;li *ngFor=&quot;let movie of movies | async; index as i&quot;&gt; { { movie.name }} &lt;/li&gt; . When is streaming not-efficient . There are some cases where streaming isn’t effective or can be used like: . Amount of data is too small. | Certain operations/transformations that require the entire data to be loaded. For example, HAL Format isn’t possible with streaming. | Sometimes batch operations are more effective than streaming. | For example, while fetching movies, you have to also fetch data about movie stars from a separate table. Since many movies might have the same movie star, it may be more effective to fetch them once in bulk rather than in a streaming fashion for each movie. . These nuances depend on what you are trying to build. Therefore it is a good “aim” to have streaming end-to-end for true reactivity. But it isn’t always applicable. .",

How to implement atomic commits in practice? . Commit and push to dev after every completing method/feature. | This push should involve both test and code. | The commit message should be accurate.

            "title": "Always choose Reactive Programming",
            "content": "What is reactive programming? . Reactive programming is not a straight paradigm like empirical or functional. Reactive means that code that is written is non-blocking and asynchronous. . Typically, whenever we have an IO operation, the thread waits for the IO operation to complete before proceeding to the following line. This consumes CPU time while the CPU is ideal. . In reactive programming, during IO operations, the thread is auto-switched. Therefore, the CPU is never ideal. . This means that reactive code has a higher throughput overall depending on the number of IO operations. Reactive code is typically several magnitudes faster and consumes fewer resources overall. . Also, traditional code doesn’t work on streaming data. If you fetch a list of records from a database, the entire list has to be loaded before you can act on it. . In reactive, however, you can work with streams of data. So, you can start performing operations on data you have received till now without waiting for the rest of the data. . Similarly, suppose you have a client-server application that needs to display a list. If you code it to be reactive, the list items can be received as a stream. Each item can be displayed one at a time. No need to wait for the entire list to load. This would significantly reduce initial load time. . Why choose reactive programming for every project? . Often a con of reactive programming is said to be the initial learning curve. In my experience, the initial learning curve is much less relevant than the return on investment it provides. . Cloud applications need to consume less memory and higher throughput. Before going for vertical or horizontal scaling, the best thing to do is optimize code. Reactive code is one of the directions to look for. . Reactive libraries are available in many programming languages. Especially the flavors of reactivex (RxJs, Rx Java, etc). Spring Webflux is a variant of Spring Boot that supports building reactive backends. . When should you not use reactive programming? . The only place not to use reactive programming is when everything can be done in memory itself i.e there is no IO operation. . My experience with reactice . I have used Project Reactor Spring Webflux and RxJS in Angular with both the experience has been this. . A much cleaner coding experience . One of the reason is it seems all reactive libraries are a sort of functional pipeline. One stage with another. . Each stage is a pure function and ideally doesn’t have any side effects. . You can think of it like a scope. . I very much agree with this video I found on Youtube. With project reactor, everything is just a Flux from start to end. No need to wrap things into different convertor classes. Everything is just Publisher. . Multithreading programming has never been easier. .",

In any communication any form, there is a some amount of context loss. But in some communication context loss is much higher. . This is because of the way sentences are phrased. Or how is someone is nervous communicating. Or what pre-assumptions someone has made which could and could not be due to lack of information. . This could be us. Or this could be the other person. . We can’t control how the other person understands. Not fully at-least. But we could try to present ourselves in a way that the other person feels more open to talk, express and communicate. . By choosing the right medium, listening better and articulating properly; one can reach close to 100% retention of information. . This would help us reach an understanding faster. The best way to do it is to keep things light and to be calm. . Choose the right medium . The tone of voice, facial expressions, body language, etc provide useful information even if they aren’t studied explicitly. It’s what our social brains are adapt to do. . Therefore, cutting these features out of communication can be problematic in certain cases. . Texting: Should not be used for emotional communication no matter how hard it feels. If it’s becoming hard, transition:Logistics Calls: Normal. Emotional. Video: Better In Person: Best. Aim for in-person communication. . Listening . Remember, the goal is to seek to understand, than to be understood. . Have the attitude of: The person you are listening to is important and worth listening to. . Having mutual respect leads to better understanding and less drama. . Listen carefully and listen everything. . No matter how silly on mundane something seems. It maybe of value to the other person. Don’t negate anything by saying it’s dumb. It may or maynot be dumb. Listen and ask followup questions. . Understand the problem instead of giving solution . Often we try to suggest a solution to something that’s not even a problem. It’s like Hammer 🔨. Wack. And nothing works. Because it wasn’t supposed to. . Life is complex and their are nuances. Those nuances need to be understood. . Learn to emphathize. . . In any case of communication, we can’t be hundred precent certain or 0% certain. Therefore we have to range ourselves between 95% certain and 5% certain. . Calm the other person . Sometimes, it may happen that the person you are talking to has intense emotions. . This could be anger, happiness, sadness. Or they might be too critical of themselves (Like someone you are reading 😇). In someway they have their guards up. . Step 1. Calm them down. . Make them drink water. . Tell them to calm down. And that way you can understand them a bit better. . Do not interrupt . Rather than interrupting, wait for when the person has stopped. Even if they are are saying something that you don’t agree with. Let them speak completely. This not only helps understand the other person better, this is more respectful. . Don’t present your arguments early on. . This makes someone jump to a different tangium. Your goal is to understand their points. . Let the person present his points. . Don’t wait for your turn . Don’t wait for your turn to speak. When the person has stopped speaking, you could take a moment to think and then speak or ask followup questions. It isn’t akward to wait and then speak. . Also, it’s not your respo to overly try to make a situation pleasant. Over trying makes situation more akward. . Speaking . Agree to what you find right. . Often someone interrupts us or are in a emotional state and are continuing to talk. Let them speak and then agree to the points you agree with. This helps establish a common base for further conversations. . If you don’t understand something, re-iterate what the person is saying and ask if it’s right. . Specially in complex or emotional issues, understanding someone is hard. Doing the aboves means that you’d have understood better and the person knows you have understood better. . Ask neutral questions . Specially on text messages. . To understand neutral questions it’s more effective to understand it’s alternative. Loaded questions. . A loaded question is where you already pick a side. . For example: . Loaded: . My friend lied to me about having a job. What should I do in this situation? . Neutral: . If someone lies about themselves? What should be done? Or how should one think about it? . Two techniques: . Remove references. Keep everything third person. | Use phrases like how should one think about this. | Think before you say and stay in the realm of truth . This can be hard at times. But think before saying, pausing is okay. Telling that you need a moment is okay. Then stay in the realm of truth and say exactly how you think or feel. . We look even dumber when we say something without actually knowing. Therefore if you don’t know something say that you don’t know and ask for help. . Express and explain better . Point to or give examples specially about you feel. Slow down. Speak slower. Be congizent of your emotions. Are you feeling too high or too low. . Ask properly and exactly what you want. Be ready to negotiate. Explain how it might benefit them. . If you are unsure about something, ask clarifying question or ask them how you should think about something. . When talking give the choice to other person . Instead of saying: I’ll come to your house this Sunday (uninvited)? . Say: Can I come to your house? . Ask instead of commanding. . Keep things civilized . We don’t want to cross someone’s boundary. It’s not worth it. . Don’t attack the person . Everyone is human. Attack the specific activity and explain why. . Everyone has an ego. You too. And everyone is trying to figure things out with information they have. . If you had an argument . Connect with them later. Lighten the mood. Tell them sorry with parts you messed up or slipped. Try to reach understanding. . . These things have to be automatic. It isn’t ideal to keep thinking about these. Pick on one area at a time to work on. .",

Defining my core values has been a step toward consciously choosing the kind of person I want to be given the ups and downs. . The reason to have freedom is to be “free” (duh!). To be free to choose what one wants to do when one wants to do it. And do not be tied to anything in particular. . What are some ways to achieve freedom? . So given the premise of freedom above, I believe these are some known ways to have a little more freedom in life. All of these are mutually exclusive. . How does money help achieve freedom? . The more money you have, the less you have to worry about a lot of things. . You could eat what you want, travel where you want, etc. . It’s not as important to have money. It’s more important to become the type of person that can make money. That would set you free. . How does commitment lead to freedom? . Children are full of potential. They are something but aren’t anything in particular. . Committing to something, be it values, a career choice, a relationship, etc gives you freedom from all the other choices that look green from the outside. They may or may not be greener but that’s a discussion for some other day. . By committing to something, you release the potential it brings. . How does detachment lead to freedom? . Detachment means having emotions under control. We assign too much importance to our emotions. Emotions are indicators but aren’t absolute truths. . Detachment keeps your mental RAM free because you aren’t attached to the outcome. aka you just don’t care. . This makes you a much more rational person. . Rationality as a way towards freedom? . Being aware of your cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and loaded language; lets you be free of them. . How does discipline lead to freedom? . This one is the ultimate. If you are disciplined, the work gets done despite resistance. . Being disciplined doesn’t mean you have to be super serious. Being super serious does the opposite. . Winning the game to become free of it? . Many games are one-time games. Like money, once you win the game of money, you’ll just have to spend a little bit of time maintaining it. . Similarly, if you have a good “personal brand” that’s reputation and truth worthy, you win everything without much effort. . If you win the game, you become free of it. . Ending notes . Freedom is a feeling. It may be that you are truly free but just don’t feel like it. . The ultimate freedom is freedom from the mind. .",

            "content": "Starting with a User’s Problem . Like any product development, the primary task is to solve a user’s problem. So you should start with the user’s problem and discuss how it could be solved. . This might lead to interesting approaches that could help. . Typically it’s not the most effective to bring people in a group to brainstorm because it often leads to one or two people dominating the conversation. It’s helpful to ask everyone to think about 3 points. And then take turns discussing each. . Once the problem is defined well and some solutions are agreed upon, one may start with defining features. Though typically, it’s better to validate the potential business and the solution before proceeding further. . Once the solution is finalized, you can start defining specifications. . The document that keeps everyone in sync . The specification is a document that describes what features are to be built exactly. . This would be a single source of direction. If something is in the spec file, it has to be built that way. If it’s not in the spec file, it should not be built. . The spec file keeps the entire organization in sync. . The product team uses it to finalize features. | The development team used to know what to work on. | The QA team used to build tests around those features. | The marketing team uses it to decide how to best market. | The documentation team uses it to create documentation. | The design team uses it to design the product. | A new member of any team uses it to learn about the product. | . Without a specification file, everyone is confused. No one person can know everything. And even if he does it creates a bottleneck and a single point of failure if the person decides to leave the organization. . Since the spec file keeps so many people in sync, details for those specific teams should also be mentioned. . Creation of Specifications . The creation of specifications is a collaborative process, involving different teams. Especially Product, Development, and QA, also known as the three amigos. . In reality, it’s best not to start by collaborating. It’s best for a single person on the product team to write down specification files. . This is because he/she knows the business better than others and typically has effective communication skills. It’s likely not the best way to test the English skills of a developer or a tester ;). . A product person would likely write in simple business terms that are understandable to all stakeholders. And since he/she understands best, the initial draft spec file would be out faster. . Next, the 3 Amigos can be followed to gain better clarification and add more information. . Too many directions . A problem someone writing the spec file can face is too many branches. The team collaborates and discovers 10 different potential paths. There is no need to travel all the paths. . Though the business and solution would have been validated, real validation happens when the user starts using the product. Therefore we should limit the number of features, and for that, it’s wise not to even write details of features we think are possible or good to have. #focus . Executable Specs . The modern way of maintaining spec files is by using feature files like Gherkin. . Gherkin provides a way to bridge the gap between what’s in the spec file and what has been developed. This is done by writing automated tests. If the test passes, we know the feature has been developed and is working. . . Specifications by Example . This also leads us to the point of how to write better specifications. The standard practice is this, described by examples. An example is how a user would interact with the system we have built. Examples solve the ambiguity. The keyword scenario is an example. . Rather than writing, a file of up to 25 MB can be uploaded. . We can write as an example: . Scenario: Disallow upload of files greater than 25 MB . Given I am on the file management page | When I upload a 26 MB file | Then the upload should fail | And should not be visible in the files list | . Scenario: Allow upload of file less than equal to 25 MB . Given I am on the file management page | When I upload a 25 MB file | Then the file should be uploaded | And visible within the files list | . Therefore in the above case, two examples/scenarios were generated, success and failure. . Behavior-Driven Development . Many other tips can make scenarios cleaner and more specific. The cleaner and more specific the scenarios are, the easier it will be for everyone to collaborate and build better products. . This whole journey encompasses BDD. BDD isn’t as specific as Test-Driven Development. The scope of BDD is much much larger and encompasses the whole product lifecycle from defining problems and validating to development and everything in between. . More Resources: .

If it’s not the right thing, we have to go back to all stakeholders (management, QA, Doc team, product team), show them a working demo and then change code accordingly. The cost of changing code is too high. And cost of keeping everyone in sync is high as well. . How specification file clarify thinking about feature? . A functional specification file can help up avoid being foggy with our approach. It can help clarify requirements at a level not possible with most other methods. . A specification file includes all details about features and scenarios that are going to be built. The scenarios are detailed and include everything that developer will have to build, no less no more. . How specification file can help everyone is sync? . Whenever anyone within organization has to discuss over features, the spec file can be shared. This will keep everyone in sync. . What problem is faced with traditional specification file? .

Typically when we write, we write something and then aim to push the quality and purpose of it. . QWD helps clarify the quality and purpose upfront. This kind of becomes a failing test like in TDD. This gives something to aim at. Now, when you answer the question, you’ll answer it precisely without dealing with other related questions/topics. . How does QDW help in breaking up paragraphs, and blogposts? . QDW also naturally breaks up paragraphs and groups related paragraphs together. Also, if you have many unrelated questions, you could break up your essay into multiple essays. (#cleanCode) . QDW forces us to have one main idea per essay. . How to do QDW? To do QDW, start by writing the topic name. And all the questions you have related to the topic. . Once you have a bunch of them written down, start answering them. .

You have a data-class SampleDataClass . @Data @RequiredArgsConstructor class SampleDataClass{ @NonNull private String name; @NonNull private String field2; ... } . In tests you initialize each field manually, . @Test //TEST 1 @DisplayName(&quot;SHOULD {someAssertion}&quot;) void should{SomeAssertion}(){ SampleDataClass sampleData = new SampleDataClass(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;field2&quot;, &quot;field3&quot;, ...); // calls and assertions } @Test //TEST 2 @DisplayName(&quot;SHOULD {second Assertions}&quot;) void should{second Assertions}(){ SampleDataClass sampleData = new SampleDataClass(&quot;anotherName&quot;, &quot;field2&quot;, &quot;field3&quot;, ...); // calls and assertions } //... more tests which declare data object . Here if you have to modify of add a new field, you’ll have a hard time. . Solution: Simple Test Data Factory . Instead, you can create a Test Data Factory. Something like . class SampleDataTestFactory{ class Given{ public static aSampleDataClass(){ // Note here name doesn&#39;t matter return aSampleDataClass(&quot;aRandomName&quot;); } public static aSampleDataClass(String name){ // this is the only place where class is initialized return new SampleDataClass(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;field2&quot;, &quot;field3&quot;, ...); } } } . Note the stucture of the classes. This is intentional. . When calling the method it would look something like this: SampleDataTestFactory.Given.aSampleDataClass() . This is a much fluent (english like) statement. . So now your tests can look something like this: . @Test //TEST 1 @DisplayName(&quot;SHOULD {someAssertion}&quot;) void should{SomeAssertion}(){ SampleDataClass sampleData = SampleDataTestFactory.Given.aSampleDataClass(); // calls and assertions } @Test //TEST 2 @DisplayName(&quot;SHOULD {second Assertions}&quot;) void should{second Assertions}(){ SampleDataClass sampleData = SampleDataTestFactory.Given.aSampleDataClass(&quot;anotherName&quot;); // calls and assertions } //... more tests which declare data object . Note that both Tests use a different simple factory method. One doesn’t care what the name field is but other does. . Most of my test factories would initialize data randomly unless explicit value is needed which is very rare. . Extending Further . Intially, I started with the just creating test data but then I realized I could club more common things in the Test Factory. . These include: . APICalls - Each method passes the parameters and return the result | MockRepository/DTO - returns an OnGoingStub for methods of repository | MockService - Similar to MockRepository but for service | Helpers - Special helpers methods for dealing with Data Object | All of these methods are public static and using them has the same fluency as above SampleDataTestFactory.Given.aSampleDataClass() .",

Rather than writing code to publish after each saves manually, we can use event listeners. Event listeners would run a piece of code each time a specific event like database save occurs. . For example: Spring Data Mongo has AbstractEventListener and ReactiveAfterSaveCallback. . class SampleEntityDataPublisher implements ReactiveAfterSaveCallback&lt;SampleEntity&gt;{ Mono&lt;SampleEntity&gt; onAfterSave(SampleEntity entity, org.bson.Document document, String collection){ return Mono.just(entity) .doOnNext(entity-&gt; Mono.just(entity) .flatMap(entity-&gt; { // code to publish }) .publishOn(Schedular.elastic()) .subcribe(); ); } } . Above, Spring Webflux code, publishOn and subscribe ensure that publishing will run in a separate thread and doesn’t affect the execution of the main thread. . Publishing Commands . In the CQRS pattern, we publish every command instead of the end state. It’s the consumer’s responsibility to choose how to interpret that command. . For example, a command could be . Movie object “Thor” was created for the USA with Id 1. Actor: “Chris Hemsworth” | Movie object was updated.

            "title": "Solving a OptimisticLockingException During Upsert in MongoDB-Spring Webflux",
            "content": "I faced a unique problem and it is worth writing about. The cause was parallel access and saving of a single document that caused OptimisticLockingException. . Problem . I had a @Document which had to be manupilated. . The @Document had a repository which extended ReactiveMongoRepository. . So it was something like this . SampleDocument.java . @Document(&quot;sample_document&quot;) class SampleDocument{ @Version Long version; @Indexed(backgroud=true) String customId; String fieldToBeModified; } . Notice @Version annotation . SampleRepository.java . interface SampleRepository extends ReactiveMongoRepository &lt;SampleDocument&gt;{ Mono&lt;SampleDocument&gt; findByCustomId(String customId); } . To update the document I had webflux code written like this: . repository.findByCustomId(someString) // Step 1 .flatmap(sampleDocument-&gt;{ // manipulation of document // Step 2 return Mono.just(sampleDocument) }) .flatmap(sampleDocument -&gt; repository.save(sampleDocument) // Step 3 ); . As you can see, the code to fetch the document (Step 1) and to save (Step 3) back are two separate lines. Between the lines are steps to manipulate the document (Step 2). . This was what caused the problem. . MongoDB uses version field in a document to maintain Locking. If the current version is 10 and you try to save 8 then this would lead to OptimisticLockingException. . In a concurrent environment like webflux when multiple thread are reading from the same data, it’s highly likely that the order the record is updated by some other thread before the current thread saves the data again. . This would specially be true where there are lots of upsert/update queries. . Solution . To fix this I switched to manually writing an update query and executing with MongoOperation. . Update updateQuery = new Update(). // code to update document return mongoOperation.findAndModify(query(where(&quot;custom_id&quot;).is(someString)), updateQuery, options().returnNew(true).upsert(true), SampleDocument.class) . Instead of 2 different DB actions. It became one DB Action. . The update query does not need to bring data back to Webflux server to manipulate the document. The document is manipulated at Database only. The database is therefore responsible for ordering the updates which was fine in my case. . Extra: Finding root cause and fixing with TDD . I’m gonna try to provide examples of TDD wherever possible. . To find the cause, I suspected the data was being saved parallelly. . So I created a unit test as follows. . Manipulate documents parallel. This was done with @RepeatableTest and @Execution(CONCURENT) | Assertion wasn’t straight forward with @RepeatableTest so I instead collected all version in a static list. | After all @RepeatableTests were over I asserted if version was as expected. | I ran the code and saw OptimisticLockingException occuring and assertion failing. | I replaced repository find and save with MongoOperation update as described above. | The test passed. | @Nested @DisplayName(&quot;WHEN upsert is called parallely&quot;) class WhenUpsertIsCalledParallelyTest{ static final Long repeatTimes = 100; static final List&lt;Long&gt; allVersions = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); @RepeatableTest(repeatTimes) // Part of Step 1 @Execution(CONCURRENT) // Part of Step 1 @DisplayName(&quot;SHOULD manipulate a single record&quot;) void shouldManipulateASingleRecord(){ // when: SampleDocument document = myService.upsert(someString).block(); // Part of Step 1 // data collection: allVersions.add(document.getVersion()); // Part of Step 2 } @AfterAll static void assertVersionIsRepeatTimes(){ assertThat(Collections.max(version)) // Part of Step 3 .isEqualTo(repeatTimes); } } .",

This would void un-neccesary rework, make sure we start the story at the right time and help make estimate for how much work can be done within a fixed time. . The lessons one can gain from creating user stories, splitting, making DOD, making DOR, etc are all transferable skill to personal planning as well. . Writing User Stories . Guiding phrases help narrow focus. . The description can be phrased this way. . As a &lt;user&gt; I want &lt;outcome&gt; so that &lt;business&gt; . Often &lt;outcome&gt; can be used as story title. . The dichotemy of User Story and a Technical Task . By the symantic of it, user story is about something a end user wants. So user stories map to features that effect users. . While developing there are also other tasks such as database migration, job creation, etc that aren’t user stories. These are technical tasks. . It’s better to classify it separately so that a business user doesn’t get confused by it. . But here is the catch, if you separate them, the business user will prioritize business stories over technical tasks. But aren’t business stories dependent? . Therefore, in real world it’s much better to have only user stories. A user story can be large if it involves too many technical sub-tasks. . A user story needs to have executable spec (BDD). Technical Tasks don’t. . . Tip: Having only User Stories means the number of user stories are less making it easier to remember and manage. Breaking User Stories . There are two major story breaking ways: . Horizontal | Vertical | . Horizontal can be thought of as breaking a story by type of activies involved like database, user interface, middleware, etc. This isn’t ideal. . Vertical . Breaking vertically means to break by functionality instead of by activity. . So it could be a functionality is itself a mixture of 2-3 smaller functionalities. We could break it as such. . Definition Of Ready and Breaking Down . Definition of Ready is when it’s right to start a user story. We don’t want to have a lot of context switches because it reduces productivity. . U-INVEST . INVEST is a good acronymn to start with to decide how big story should be. . Independent: Is the story dependent on any other story? | Negotiable | Valuable | Estimatable | Small : Is the story atomic or does it contains multiple sub-stories? | Testable | . The invest remains same as sizing of stories. . The U is for User Interface. . I found there are other things involved here too, like: . API : if it’s an API, you may want to do API First Development | Learning : is there any learning involved? | . Definition of Done . Defination of done is when we can say the story ended. .

Value is only delivered when a task in complete. . It’s not valuable to have many infinished tasks. Therefore, start the tasks that are closest to finish. Finish them first before picking up new ones. . If you are using a Agile/Kanban Board, start from the rightmost part of the board. This also fits really well with “Walking the board” method of Daily Standup where team starts with talking about the rightmost task and walks towards the left. . Mono Task. Do one thing at a time. You’ll save 50% more time. . A tip: Keep your phone outside the room. Your productivity will improve infinitely. . Keep a mental note/recalibration of every next hour . This would automatically focus you. Every hour. But maybe not every minute. . Return to the board/tracker often . Ideally return multiple times in the day. This works really well with previous tip. . The board/tracker should be upto date. Updating board during Daily Standup or other meeting is a “Moment of Glory”. 1 This means that board/tracker wasn’t in upto date state. . Aim to have no “Moments of Glory”. . Limit time/spike . Almost all tasks can be estimated to a few hours or a day. Even if someone estimates a task to a day, he/she will really actually work on it for a few hours. So aim to estimate to hours. . If a task isn’t estimatable, it needs to be broken down. . Once the task is estimated to hours, pomodoro or something similar can be used. . Focused hours/pomodoros . Pomodoros are most effective way to get tasks done. . Pomodoro incorporates both Mono-tasking and recalibration. . 25 minutes of focus without distraction provides a mono-task environment. If anyone/anything interrupts, you could say you are on a Pomodoro and will connect back later. . The breaks in pomodoro have a effect of recalibration. Specially if you will go away from 5-10 minutes, you come up with better strategy. . Keep track of distractors/distractions . Learn to let things wait. . Keep a list of distractions in a separate list. These are things that make you want to stop/block your particular card/task and switch to it. Or it can be something else you need to do. . This could include: . A person you want to follow up or help | A task that needs to be done | Something that needs to be ordered. | Etc | Identify improvements and organize . Along with planning, identifying and improving on timewaster will give back more time. -&gt; Time Assets. . Have a set of rituals that help your organizes. Some of these can include: . Cleaning up your Agile/Board at end of the day | Shutting down the computer (not hibernate) at 6 PM each day. | Going through and deleting tasks bookmarks, files, notes, photos every Friday. | Cleaning up the room every weekend. | Development That Pays - YouTube Channel &#8617; . |",

            "content": ". Introduction . SW Architecture is one of the most important pillars of an SW project. Following Engineering and Agile practices are part of the equation too. But having a clean extensible architecture facilitates a much faster development. . When working with a group of people, it is significantly time-consuming to enforce rules for maintainability. For example, it’s common to find different classes that do the same thing named differently. Some team member names it controllers. Some name it “handler”. . Similarly, some places need special care. For example, the API Requests body needs to be validated. . There are a few ways to enforce architecture: . Strong Linter | Creating Helper Libraries | Architecture Testing | This particular post will focus on Architectural Testing. . What are Architecture Tests? . Architecture tests help enforce rules that are otherwise missed by linters. Linters provide some coding standards but usually aren’t sophisticated enough for the capabilities architecture testing can provide. . For example, if you have a java @Entity and want to ensure all of it has certain javax validation whenever someone creates a new @Entity. . Libraries for Architecture Testing . I found two libraries: . ArchUnit: For Java | TsArch: Typescript version of ArchUnit | ArchUnit . ArchUnit provides Architecture Testing for Java and works well with JUnit. . Example: If you want to ensure all String fields for Request Objects have @Size annotation, you could write it with ArchUnit. . fields() .that() .haveRawType(String.class) .should() .beAnnotatedWith(Size.class) . Since I started using ArchUnit, the quality of code has improved by a huge margin. . Implement Architecture Testing as TDD . With architecture testing, the work of an architect now expands and can live long after the architect is gone from the project since every architectural decision is written as a test. . I try to implement this the same way. . For example, I want all tests to be really fast. I had written an article about it. And one of the ways is that it requires avoiding @DirtiesContext in Spring Boot. And forcing the developer to choose between parallel execution and non-parallel execution. . I can share it with the team and hope everyone follows it. . But we developers have too many things on our plate, and we juggle a lot. And mostly, it’s the code reviewer who’ll asses these decisions. . So, I instead write these are ArchTests. . Also, ArchTests can be thought of as TDD. Before starting, the architect decides how everything should look and grow. . Formatting ArchUnit Tests . I like the method/when/then format. I have a format that makes it easier to write arch unit tests. . classes/methods/fields . that: have | should | . More Resources . I have read many resources while trying to learn about ArchUnit. Here are a few: . Using ArchUnit To Enforce Architecture Best Practices | Archunit: Validate the architecture of our projects | TsArch: Typescript version of ArchUnit | .",

            "content": ". . Note: For beginners: Tests provide fast feedback to your code and ensure everything works as you intended. Rapid tests help get feedback and ensure your integration and deployment pipelines work faster. There are several ways I recently discovered that increase speed on Spring Boot + JUnit tests substantially. From 8 minutes to 3 minutes. . Some of these are . Use Right Test Slice (Saved 25% running time) | Speeding up @SpringBootTest and avoiding @DirtiesContext (Saved 25% running time) | Run tests in parallel (Saved 37% running time) | . Use Right Test Slice (Saved 25% running time) . Several runners come with Spring Boot. . @SpringBootTest is the most general of them. Primarily this is used in combination with @DirtiesContent, which will restart spring boot after every test class by default which isn’t ideal. . Using @SpringBootTest is Integration Tests. We don’t want every test to use this. . We want to load the minimum spring-boot infrastructure as possible and still ensure accurate tests. There are a few things that can help: . If tests are related to a DB. Use @DataMongoTest or equivalent JPA runner with @Import annotation. | If tests are related to Web/Controller. Use @WebFluxTest or equivalent Spring MVC runner. If you want to use embedded MongoDB with it, use @AutoConfigureDataMongo. Most other systems also have annotations starting with @AutoConfigure{systemName} | Important: If tests require initializing a single bean. Use @ExtendWith(SpringRunner.class) with @Import to specify the bean to initialize. | The best case: Aim for Tests that are purely java based and do not involve spring boot, but it isn’t possible in every scenario. | Speeding up @SpringBootTest and avoiding @DirtiesContext (Saved 25% running time) . @DirtiesContext is an annotation that recreated the Spring Context after each test or each test class. To avoid using @DirtiesContext, ensure all your tests don’t depend on the same data. For this, you can wrap your data creation in a test data factory and ensure the data produced is random. . As previously mentioned, one should avoid using @SpringBootTest, but if you can’t do without it, ensure you use WebEnvironment.MOCK without @DirtiesContext. . @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.MOCK) . Try to use it with @Import or @ContextConfiguration to limit the creation of beans. . . Run tests in parallel (Saved 37% running time) . Create a junit-platform.properties file in test/resource/junit-platform.properties and add the following minimum. 1 . junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true . Now you can either use one of these, . add the following to every class you want to run parallel. @Execution(CONCURRENT) | add more to junit-platform.properties | junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default = same_thread|concurrent junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default = same_thread|concurrent . 1 . Some tests can’t run parallelly, so I prefer manually adding @Execution(CONCURRENT). . I found data tests with @DataMongoTest by asserting over different data. . Another positive side effect of having @Execution(CONCURRENT) is that these tests run first. And since these tests are faster than the SAME_THREAD mode, they lead to instant feedback. . .

Most time assets are generatlly slower and more stuctured which is why they are usually avoided. Time liabilities on the other hand feel easy to get started with so they are done more. So, one needs to make it easy to get started on time-assets and harder to get started on time-liabilities. . Some of the most impactful time-assets and liabilities are: . Time-Assets Time Liabilities . **Planning**: Even a little bit of planning, something like 10 minutes alone creating a written plan could save hours, days, or even years. Planning allows course correction. Ideally, don’t start working without a plan. | **Rushing**: Though it may seem you are making progress. The probability is higher that you are moving in the wrong direction. It’s better to fix a plan | . **Meditation**: | **Instagram** | . **5 Min Rule**: Don’t allow yourself to be down or procrastinate for more than 5 minutes. During such time ask yourself: Is this worth the return on my time?Remember you can’t live forever. | Forever Rule: **The opposite of 5 min rule**: Letting fear/laziness/indecision stop you. | . **WIP Limit**: Focus on a few things and complete them. If your WIP limit is exceeded, don’t add work on newer tasks unless older ones are complete. | **Trying to change people**: You cannot change people. You can suggest but cannot force. Leading by example. It’s the best option you have. | . **Pomodoro**: Working in Pomodoros keeps you focused. If you can’t work with Pomodoro, you haven’t planned carefully enough.To have Pomodoro sessions.1. Create a distraction-free zone.2. Plan your tasks. Ideally, pick a deliverable.3. Put on headphones and play instrumental/[focus music](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx65qkgCWNJIs3FPaj8JZhduXSpQ_ZfvL).4. Work on the task using [a Pomodoro app](https://pomofocus.io/).5. Stick to break schedule religiously. Get away from the room during the break but no internet. One Pomodoro is better than zero Pomodoro. |   | .

The biggest problem is maintaining up-to-date documentation. These are a few things I have learned recently about this: . . 1. The best way to document is to automate . Tools like Swagger for APIs and storybook from UI components make it very easy to auto-document code in most cases. . 2. Encourage use of your own documentation . Using your own documentation would help you find and fix bugs in it. . For example, You could encourage your team to use Swagger UI instead of Post Man for testing APIs. . 3. For within the team: Have a shared wiki . Wiki helps keep everyone in sync and like the previous point, encourages updations wherever necessary. . 4. Tests are also documentation of sorts but for the internal team only. . Tests capture what the code would do. So for a new dev on a team, going and reading through tests can give him an idea of what the code does. .",

It can seem cubersome but there are mindsets and tools that can make transition smoother. . TDD is shown to reduce defectsby a large margin. Tests will save you time in the long run. . Question Doing TDD is faster than traditional development? . | True . | Correct! This might seem counter intuitive at first. . | . | False . | Over a long time scale and after the initial learning curve . | . You have successfully completed this question! Check Answer Try Again Why TDD? . By writing your tests first, you are defining expections you have with your code early on. This leads to cleaner code. . The opposite is you write code and then you try to create tests. It’s hard to decide what to test when you are writing tests later. If you write tests later, you do it for what is working. . Both tests and code written with TDD is cleaner and precise. . TDD leads to extremely fast feedback. . The Three Laws of TDD . You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass. | You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures. | You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test. | How to TDD? . Assume the test will work properly, what is the minimum test? Write that test. | Fix compilation errors if any. 1 | Write minimum code required to pass the test. | Run all the tests | Iterate | I have written a detailed blogpost on how I do TDD. . Making TDD easier . Usually TDD can be cumbersome because: . Testing is extra code | You have to switch between current code and tests | you have to rerun tests | No one does it | Mitigrations . 1. TDD is a todo list of feature to do . By writing test first, you get clear on what you want to implement. This leads to better design. . Also, initially it’s hard to think about what to do. All tests essentially fix the inputs/external conditions to the method and verify either the output or internal state change caused by the method. . method/when/should can also be helpful here. . TDD only that much functionality and nothing more. Only test what’s within the class. not outside it. . Also, when deciding to learn a piece of code, read both code and the tests. . 2. Switch between testing and code easily . In intellij press Ctrl + Shift + T for vs code : https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Acino.jump-source . 3. Rerun tests automatically . On local: have tests run automatically after each save . Given when tehn Search for libraries that make easier to test . 4. No one does it . Yeah. It takes times to learn. TDD/any development practice is easier when whole company is aiming at it or enforcing it. . More tips . 1. Don’t start the application. Verify everything by writing tests. . This works for test after code too. But specially works for TDD. . Instead of verifying by starting the application then going to browser or database, verify by writing and running the test. . Starting the application and testing is usually a longer process than writing a test. Plus, their is a compounding time saving when rerunning the test instead of manual verification. .

Typescript is much more superior to JS. React can be used with typescript too but it’s a developer’s choice. . React is easy to get started . Especially with functional components, getting started with react is too easy. . React has too many little things to take care of. . Strength can be a weakness or one could say React isn’t a full framework. . React has too much to learn. And every project is essentially different. . Angular comes with preferred ways of doing things which I like more than base React. Angular has everything important built-in. So you’ll find every Angular project uses the same set of libraries for common tasks like rest call (HttpClient). There is less to learn and remember. . You essentially want to reduce knowing a lot of things so that you can focus on getting stuff done. . Code Cleanliness . Assuming React is used with Typescript, functional react with hooks is a much better way of creating components than class-based React and Angular. . Plus I like JSX (React) than HTML templating(Angular), it’s concise and there is less to remember. HTML templating in angular requires remembering an additional set of code (ngFor, ngIf, etc). In JSX, it’s the same language used while creating components. . The code structure is much better in angular projects. . Every angular project is structured similarly. . By default, CSS management is also better in angular. Every component has its own CSS.

There are many aspects to authenticity; . knowing who you truly are: self-awareness | acting in way that is truly you | This doesn’t mean you don’t change.

This can be a strategy we need to adopt, something that we have been doing that needs to be changes or something that we had been escaping that we should do. . We don’t control what happens, we control how we respond. Often things we are faced with may not be our faults but it’s our responsibility to pick it up voluntarily. . The more voluntary responsibility we are able to pick up, the more powerful and in control we would feel even if some area of life has minor temporary set backs. .

Typescript only adds a few extra features which are convenient for developers. . Typechecks . Probably the main reason to use typescript is this. . Having typechecks remove unneccesary errors. Types makes code more predictable. . Dynamically typed programming language have bad IDE support. . VS Code has fantastic support for Typescript with typeaheads which are and will probably always be missing with Javascript. . Everything is configurable. .

Where to put the final output | Ability to choose how strict the language is aka enable/disable following null checks | any assignments | etc | . | Shortcut paths | . Typescript compiles to JS .

When you have a large application with lots of connected pieces, it makes sense to have connections between them standard. . So that as the application grows, the connections stay strong.

What are values? . Values are often hidden, sometimes unknown, and a highly personal frame with which people operate. Our values define who we are and what choices we’ll make in different situations. . Values apply to everything we do. Be it known or unknown scenarios. . If you are faced with a problem that you have already solved, then you’ll rely on your experience or skill for it. If you are faced with an unknown problem, then you’ll depend on your values. Therefore it is important to consciously develop your value and choose better ones. . If you don’t choose our values well, then you’ll give a fuck about too many things. Most of those things are unnecessary and make us unhappy. . Therefore, choosing your values is choosing what to give a fuck about, and that in turn makes us have a more meaningful life. . Exploring and choosing your values leads to the highest level of self-awareness where you move beyond what you feel and why you feel a certain way. . Why define them explicitly? . To have your values articulated means you can use them much more easily while making decisions. . There are many things we inherit from immitation. So sometimes we do things are are naturally good at it. . But when sitation is a bit different, we change. . It has happened that in certain times of my life I have been a natural at many of my core values. But since I didn’t have a developed mind, it faded. And then I had to relearn them and focus on the nuances. . Good and Bad Values . Good Values Bad Values . Socially Constructive | Socially Destructive | . Based on reality/truth | Superstitious | . Requires work internally aka on oneself. Doesn’t rely on external people, events, or scenarios being a certain way. | Depends heavily on external events, people, and scenarios to be a certain way. | . Since it’s internal: it’s immediate and controllable | Since it’s not internal: It’s not immediate or controllable | . Example: Honesty | Example: Not being alone for a while. | . For each value we choose or decide to choose, we can run through the list and decide if it’s good or bad. . Implementing values . Focus on the value rather than the specific scenarios/tip . Learn to resist searching for specific scenarios/tips. Focus on value instead. The former applies to certain situations. Values would apply to every situation. . Living your values doesn’t have to involve infinite googling. It does require infinite introspection. . Try coming up with your own strategies . Every value is going to be a collection of micro-routines and habits. Many of these habits are going to be something that you have had for 20+ years. . And a lot of it is going to be modified or changed on an ongoing basis. . So, you’ll have to come up with your own set of strategies first. This will require some first-principle thinking. And often require modification to small things. . Habits are the best way to enforce a value/identity. As you repeat a habit, you find more and more evidence of your new value. . CRUD your values over time . CRUD is a programming term that stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. . As you grow, you’ll have access to new information. Sometimes you may even find the value is no longer surviving its purpose. . Similarly, sometime you may find that slightly changing your values gives it new and deeper meaning. #likeAGoodVariableName . If you have a particularly bad event, you can verify your actions on your values. You may find that you might not have lived up to your values fully. Or it may be time to tweak your value a bit. . Learn to identify values . Learn to identify values in yourself and others. . How? . Look at a piece or a set of actions in situations. Resist the urge to look at what the person is saying. | Determine what must be a shared value supporting the actions. | Resist the urge to have a backstory. | Determine if the value is good or bad or if your values match. | Having a backstory justifies actions. Values aren’t about justifying the past or present. It’s about how one acts. . Example 1: //TODO . Ankush is an honest person. He says he is honest. Ankush seems to tell everything non-stop. Even at times when it’s hard. Sometimes, he’s too blunt which makes him disconnect from people. Even his close family members and friends find it hard to bear him sometimes. When they do bring something up, he attacks. This makes people not wanna tell him the truth. But Ankush does think about what they said and scrutinize it. When he realizes he’s wrong or likely wrong, he does tell people that they were right. But sometimes it’s too late. . Here it seems: . Ankush is honest. | And at the same time, Ankush doesn’t care enough about other people’s feelings. | And insecure about being wrong/criticized. | But it seems sometimes he realized he’s wrong and does say he’s wrong and apologized. | Therefore a few values some up: . Honesty | Not caring about other people’s feelings | Handing early criticism with an attack | Impatience | Probably trust issues with other people’s opinions early on. (needs to think things completely to accept) | . Note that these are early assumptions and that they are in fact assumptions. A situation has many nuances and especially if you are looking from the outside, it may be hard. . Look at both good values and bad values . People are weird. We always have a mix of good values and bad values. . Using the process for yourself and others, you might come across both. . Often other people’s feedback is also a good place since we might be blinded by our own. . Some values seem good on the surface but are bad. . For example: Being excessively open . Choose your own values . Every individual is different, therefore it is important to build your own set of values to follow. Don’t borrow someone’s values. Define your own. . Expect it to take forever . With time you’ll find more imp values. Therefore, it’s highly unlikely that your values will be fixed forever. They might evolve with time. . Optional: Nuances about values . Relation between Values, Systems and Happiness: In Atomic Habits, James Clear talks about how having system run everyday leads to happiness. You don’t have to have reached your goal as long as your system is running. Values are the ultimate system. | Result of value: Acting on values is immediate but the reward of good values isn’t always “happy” in the short term. | Surrendering to your values: If you have good values, technically you can surrender yourself to them and everything will be fine. In some sense, without goal, you still have values to guide you. Even if you have a dark place, your values would hold you up together. | Expected Value vs Actual Value: We often pick values. That doesn’t mean we embody them. Our actual values are what we do in situations. Therefore, out goals is to have closer expected and actual values. | Doing poorly in an area of life? It maybe that our Actual Values aren’t sorted well or executed on. | If you are searching for too much tip, you have some root cause value causing problems. Working on values is better in the long term. Quick hack may seem the way for now. But in long term, it’s the value | . | Values and Tough Decisions: Values are most important when making tough decisions. Tough decisions are already “tough” (surprise surprise). By focusing on value, we offload some stress. | . Optional: Values and other concepts . Rationality: Humans are rational agents only within the scenario aka he/she is in a local minima. We need guiding principles to make optimal decisions. | Decision Making: It isn’t always possible to make the most optimal decision. We have limited knowledge and time, and we need to act. | Value-Based Decision Making: Decisions are made on values rather than facts. These provide good heuristics. | Resistance: In the real world, you’ll often be faced with choices that tempt you to not take on your chosen value. | This could be a person or situation. Each decision is a test of your value. | One has to give up something to uphold something else. | Every decision you make is a vote for or against a value. Don’t vote for what you don’t want. | . | Value and Identity: Often we can’t let go of a value because we have tied it up to our identity. We need to keep our identity simple to have a good impact. | Value is an Activity/Habit: Something that is necessary and repeatable. You can’t have a wage value. You have to be specific. | Values in social situations: You’ll find that often you like and respect people who share similar values. | This is especially important for close relationships: family, spouse, business partners, etc. | You can usually pick up others’ values if you listen to them cuz most people essentially speak the same things over and over again. | . | Sharing your values and building boundaries: Having strong boundaries and explaining/sharing what your values are with others will help them and you adapt to your values better. | . Optional: Resources for learning more about values . Book: The subtle art of not giving a Fuck: Mark talks about the importance of developing a value system. If our values are poorly chosen, we suffer. | He describes what constitutes good and bad values, then goes on the describe 5 values based on “The backward law”. These values cover: A radical approach to responsibility. | Being less certain of yourself and being okay with being wrong. | Failure is the way forward | Important of saying and accepting no | Contemplating details | | The most important line I found was this (paraphrased): “This book will allow you to fall back and still be okay” | Mark’s blog focuses on personal values too and he explores many areas, especially relationships. | The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck - Summarized by the Author | . | Jordan Peterson According to Jordan, people should try to develop a vision for themselves.

Step by step | Have a clear road to some kind of implementation | As real world as possible. | For example: . For Music: . I tried learning Piano by reading book but it was no boring and vage. So I purchased SimplyPiano. | Similarly for guitar I got SimplyGuitar. | . For Programming Topics, . I prefer platform allow trying out code online without any local installation. Codecademy is a good one. I used it for many things. | Recently I started learning | . | . Increase the number of iterations . This doesn’t mean more time. This means more iterations. . For example: If you want to make good Kanban boards, make many Kanban boards and use it in your life . Role of Books . I don’t use books for learning everything. . But certain concepts are such that they require an entire book. . I don’t go out to but book instantly. I wait a few days to see if I really need to. . Sometimes YouTube videos are enough to cure curiosity or find the answer. . Books are great for deep topics have a lot of details in it. . Learn in chunks . I cannot learn something at one. If I try to do it I will have to recollection of the concepts. So I prefer doing a little every day or regularly. . This also forces me to recall what I had previously learned. . So for, . Piano and Guitar: 10 Min a Day | Technical Topics: Max 2 Pomodoros (25 min timers twice with 5-10 min break in middle) | Books: 10-20 minutes max | . Clear Doubts along the way . If you are stuck, search for the solution. . Usually learning from different sources helps. . Have Cheat Sheets . Cheat sheets allow recalling what you have learned instantly! . Often googling cheatsheets is sufficient. . Put into Practice Fast . Deployable. . Record yourself. . Talk to other people . Using flash cards . Flashcards can be helpful addition to remembering more. In many things, there is a need to remember more. . Here are some things to keep in mind when using flashcards. . Use 80/20 rule and focus on the few concepts worth memorizing. You want number of cards to be at a minimum. | Assume each card is going to take 10 seconds per revision. Multiple by number of cards you create to get how much time you’ll remember. | Know all the concepts first and organize them. Maybe use a highlighter, pen to mark them. | If a flashcard is too big to remember, then break it down. | Write in memorable way, good questions and for answers use diagrams, accronyms or some patterns. | Digital Flashcards have advantage that you can modify. But maybe having less number of flashcard overall is better. | You may expect 1-2 hours of flashcard study a week. If it’s a competitive exam, then per day. . Flashcards are one part.

Every sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.2 But as more and more people understand and use the technology, the magic fades and it becomes an everyday affair. . There are 3 interconnected factors that influence this: . Abstraction and Field Maturity | Demand and Cost | Education | Abstraction and Field Maturity . Abstraction makes it easy for programmers to learn new things. Open Source projects are best at these. . Every advanced technology eventually comes to a point where simple statements get the job done without need to understand details. . It takes long time for things to get polished. Open Source projects spend years perfecting things. . Web Technologies is probably in it’s most mature state. Like with Spring Boot: . You have integrations to include things like Batch Processing, Database Connectivity, Micro Services, Security, etc. | Each of which at one point in time were totally a big subject to learn and implement. Now most are a few hours of configuration. | . Like with Arduino: . Arduino has different environment, chips and hardware that make it easy for anyone to quickly prototype and test hardware products. | There are modules available for camera, microphones, sensors, etc. | All of which are abstracted and the only things connecting them are arduino and programming. | . Deep Learning: . Deep Learning is also getting to a state of maturity where things that required special knowledge are replaced with easy abstractions. | Frameworks like Tensorflow are providing out if the box solution for common activities like Recommender Systems. | . Research eventually give rise to applied applications. . Demand and Cost . More a product is needed, the more innovative solutions are made to make it cheaper and available to as many people as possible. #capitalism . Once it is available to more people, more innovative uses come out of it. . Software is cheaper to replicated therefore pace of innovation is much faster. . Hardware costs are variable in different countries. China has had a lot of hardware innovations because the cost of hardware is much lower due to high supply. . Role of Education . YouTube and online video in general has been a revolutionary technology. A man is limited to opportunities he/she gets. Online video allows for opportunity for everyone to learn the same thing. . Books are boring for most folks. . Space? . I believe once SpaceX reaches Mars, we’ll go through a similar cycle for space technology too.

One is only concerned with questions like the meaning of life if what they are doing in the present moment is not good enough to demand their full attention. | By becoming aware of the present moment we enjoy what life really is in the present. | And we have this power at any time of the day. | . You don’t have to have an opinion . You don’t have to have a personal opinion about everything. . Not exhaustive . Apart from Osho, Sadhguru and Sam would have a similar belief: . One of level, these concepts that the mind is the one that creates problems make sense. But I believe they shouldn’t be treated as exhaustive. . I have always wondered why buddhism advocates for both control of your mind and control of your actions. . This is probably because, just being control of your mind and letting the world fall apart is not only hard to achieve but it is stupid in some sense. We benefit a lot from facing and solving problems not only for ourselves but for the people around us. . Punctuate your day with moments . When talking about mindfulness, Sam Harris recommends following approach apart from a formal sitting practice: “Punctuate your day with moments of awareness.”. .

Being truthful assumes that what you know to be true may not be 100% truth but you’ll speak, act and convey in a way in which you know it is as true ads possible. .

Using --registry npm install --registry &lt;link-to-repository&gt; . | Creating a project level .npmrc file . | . Inside the file write: registry=&lt;link-to-repository&gt; . Managing node_modules . use yarn instead of NPM . yarn is a package manager just like npm but it provides a few features that make it better. . multi-threaded download. This makes yarn much faster than npm which only supports single-threaded downloads. | offline mode. Once a package is downloaded, it can be downloaded again. even if the node_modules folder is deleted. This is because yarn stores a backup of everything. | . If you are not using yarn, zip node_modules before making dependency upgrades . Often things don’t go smoothly when upgrading changes dependencies. Since, node_modules are ignore in git, the only way to revert or switch between branches with dependencies is a clean npm install. . Yarn supports offline line mode which means nothing is downloaded if dependencies had been updated once. If you are not using yarn, zip node_modules before making dependency upgrades. You can unzip it easily if you need to revert. . Skip above node_modules tips and use pnpm . Installations: npm i -g pnpm . Usage: pnpm install . pnpm is a disk efficient package manager which stored all node_module packages in one place and used sim links for installing within projects. If you have a same package in multiple project, pnpm will make sure to download and store it only once. .",

FetchModes allow you to say to Hibernate to fetch all childrens at once instead of fetching them one at the time. . FetchMode is different from FetchType.EAGER or LAZY. The former is used to decides where to fetch children along with parent or later when needed. . FetchMode.JOIN . @Fetch(FetchMode.JOIN) List&lt;EntityType&gt; entityName; .

One for parent @Entity | One for for each child @Entity type will be run. After the query is run all chilren of particular type will be fetched. | . FetchMode.SUBSELECT is also seems to better when used to FetchType.LAZY. Here, all parent entities will be fetched first. When child entities are needed, all child entities will be fetched at once instead of multiple queries. .",

This is because the value of @Id often needs to be fetched from database and set to the @Entity before save. Therefore multiple transactions need to me made. . You can check this behavior by using the following application.properties and then checking logs. . spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true . Speeding Up Writes . Spring Data JPA allows for storing multiple records at once but multiple things have to be set first. . 1. Switch to Sequence Generator for primary key . Batch writes does not work with GenerationType.IDENTITY. . Make using sequence_generator . @Id @SequenceGenerator(name = &quot;seqName&quot;, sequenceName = &quot;seqName&quot;, allocationSize = {allocationSize}) private Long id; . The {allocationSize} is how many writes you wish to do at once in case of a large list of entities. . 2. Create the sequence in your database . Make sure that increment size is equal to {allocatedSize} used in @GenerateValue . 3. Add JPA Property . Add the following property . spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size={allocatedSize} . Within Code . repository.saveAll(listOfEntities); . How things work under the hood? . Once a list of entities need to be saved, JPA will make request to database for getting the next value of sequence generator. . This value will be set to the @Id of the first @Entity . Since we already have already provided {allocationSize}, JPA knows can automatically fill in values exist between the current value of sequence generator and the next. . Therefore JPA does not need to ask DB each time for the value to be set as primary key. . Example: . There is a sequence which increments by 1000. . We want to save a list of 500 entities to the database. . JPA asks database for value of sequence. . Database return value of 1. . JPA knows that the next increment is at 1000 so, it can fill in values between 1 and 1000. . JPA sets 1 to 500 to @Id field to entities. All the entities are together sent to the DB as a single transaction. . Suppose we get around want to save another 100 new entities. . JPA knows the last @Id it set was 500 and it was 499 more @Id values it can use. . So it for the new 100 entities, it set @Id values between 500-600 without asking Database for sequence value. .",

This post highlights some of my DB preferences. A Database design is highly dependent on the application so there may not apply to every DB. . Aim for DB with Only Tables. No Stored Procedures, Functions or Views . Your DB for the most part should be such that the only operation you to CRUD and simple lookups. . Therefore a lot of effort should be taken to designing extremely reusable and simple tables. . In one of my projects, I had created an extremely efficient data pipeline. . Their were multiple views in a hierarchical tree calling one another. If you looked up on root view and applied some filters, you would get the data you want. This data needed to be inserted into a separate table so I created stored procedure to do it. . In coming months, new things were added the stored procedure and it became so complex that it is now to risky to tinker with. . Therefore now, I prefer DB which has no DB side functions or procedures, or if possible without views. If there is a complex query I every much prefer storing and triggering the queries from on the backend server. . There shouldn’t be multiple tables doing the same job. . Simple and Reusable Tables . If you have a social media type feature, it is best to have a single table to track likes than have multiple like tables for each type of data. . Keep Data within Database Platform Independent . A common problem that happens when you store something like HTML is what would happen if classes or tags are modified. One would have to write a migration script and image all the scenarious. This is a lot of work. . Therefore, database ideally shouldn’t store HTML or a particular DSL. . Instead have a converter at the backend to do the conversion from data within database to HTML or DSL. This would mean that you can swap in and out different DSLs over the same data. . Column Names . For primary key id is enough. . Many prefer using &lt;table_name&gt;_id as primary key but adding table_name is unnecessary. We already know what table it is. . In case of joins between, &lt;table_name&gt;_id will be same length as selecting column with dot &lt;table_name&gt;.id. . Also, if you have just id you can quickly identify a foreign key which has column in this format &lt;table_name&gt;_id. . Indexing . I identify the columns which require joins or search. . And then index in the order in which they are called most. . Liquibase XML Format . Liquibase is a tool for managing DB Deployments. . Using something like Liquibase XML format allows you to be DB independent and makes migration easy. . For Complex Analytics Operations . For complex analytics use cron jobs to store data in separate table 1 or use Materialized Views 2 . TechLead &#8617; . | Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann &#8617; . |",

Though you won’t always build something awesome from scratch and instead configure an existing tool to do the job, without DevOps you won’t be free to code. You’ll spend all your time maintaining and deploying your code manually. In this post, I’ll try to convince you why upper management likes DevOps so much. Where did DevOps come from? . There are 2 separate engineers. . One who made the product -&gt; Developer | The other who made sure the product is running properly -&gt; Operations Engineer | . Operations Engineer’s role included: . Deploying application to server | Making sure it is operating properly | . Increasingly, some of the roles of Operation Engineers became so repeatable that it could be automated. Also, certain problems that operation engineer might face was much more easily handles if softwares were developed a certain way. . These gave rise to DevOps. . What is DevOps? . DevOps is a mixture if tools and practices that make it efficient to build and maintain code. . Agile is what to do. DevOps is how to do. . DevOps practices occupies different stages of product development and beyond. . DevOps is such a broad term with loose definition that many other concepts are plugged into DevOps as a “best practice”. For example: Pair Programming. . DevOps also get’s merged with security and called DevSecOps. Security is usually an afterthought. But DevSecOps aims to fix security problems in the phase that created it making it much less costly to fix it. . You cannot copy another organizations DevOps structure as it is. Your organization and products are unique. Make your own style. Don’t copy everything that google or facebook do, though you can learn a lot from them. . Since DevOps relies so much on automation tools, some things can be achieved faster. . Increase compliance | Streamlining of processes | Automating repeatable tasks | . All the tools and practices results to: . Increasing speed of deployments Very important to stay ahead of competition even if core of business is not software. | . | Increasing quality of software Allowing making changes easily and reducing bugs | . | Reducing cost of discovery and fixing issues Bugs discovered faster can be fixed early | All this reduces downtime. | . | . Some DevOps practices and accompanying tool that are very helpful are. . Build Automation: Jenkins | DB Automation: Liquibase, Flyway | Code Linting: Sonar, CAST | Continuous Integration (CI) | Continuous Delivery (CD) | Continuous Deployment (CD) | Continuous Monitoring: ELK, Databriks | API Management: Mulesoft | Test Driven Development (TDD) | Behavious Driven Development (BDD) | .

Once upon a time, sea shells 🐚 were used as value/money. But sea shells or other exhanges were hard to carry so later inventions such as coins, then cash and now money also includes numbers in a computer followed. . Value of Money . Money is only valuable when it is limited. If there is infinite money, the value of each individual unit will reduce and you need more money in exchange of same value. . Simplified example . Imagine there if there is 1000 unit of a currency in circulation. . At this place, 1 unit buys you a house. . Let’s suppose, the government decided to print more money and now 1000 more printed units are being added. . Now, the same house will hypothetically require 2 units of currency. . The value of single unit was reduced by half. . Commodity Currency . To avoid this, previously gold was used to set an upper limit. For each note you could exchange it for a real gold kept somewhere safe. This is called commodity currency. . There were even gold coins. If you had gold even if you don’t believe in the currency, you could still use it in other ways because gold was valuable. . Fiat Currency . But around 1960s in US, gold was removed because governments could not simply print money to pay of their debts. . This got called as Fiat currency. The current which has no backing. Enough people believe in the value of the fiat currency, therefore it is used ad money. . Essentially with fiat currency like dollar, government make life easier for them but at the same time make life difficult for normal people holding the money. . Cryptocurrencies . Cryptocurrencies remove this power from the government and aim to decentralize it amoung individuals. . Bitcoin has an upper limit. There can never be more 21 million and inflation in Bitcoin is accurately predictable. . Governments cannot just control how many bitcoins or another other decentralized currency are exchanged. . Money for most of history was believed and regulated by the free market. It is only in recent history that it became highly regulated and centralized by governments. .

The more applicable information you can find, the more you can apply them and make better decisions. . Why information should be applied? . Information if not applied is meaningless unless it is your profession to find and document new information. . By applying information faster, you will solve your problems faster or at-least move towards solving your problems faster. . The information that is not applied will be forgotten. . You don’t always have time to sit and learn/consume something end to end. There is a high need for having on site learning mindset. Because it is the most optimal in terms of learning, applying and time. . Just in Case vs Just in Time . We fall into trap of consuming “just in case” information which we believe will be useful someday. Unless we are learning for fun, we should ideally focus on “just in time” information. . For example: While job searching, it is better to prepare while actively giving interviews than by waiting months before starting applying for jobs. The probability that you’ll have to relearn everything is high. . Catchup when need be 1 . It’s better to wait for a good amount of information to accumulate before consuming it rather than consume a constant stream of data. . A good way to follow this is to avoid all feeds and recommender systems. . Example: . Rather than consuming breaking news every few minutes, it’s better to let things accumulate for a day or so before consumption. Most breaking news is often low quality and is rarely important longterm. . Finding applicable information . There are many ways to find applicable information, these are a few that come to mind. . Planning . A plan may or may not be used, but planning is useful because it uncovers many aspects of the problem. Also, it is easier to discovers paths to avoid. . Questions . Frame your questions accurately. . Know the right people who can answer your question. Internet also allows us to connect to “experts” who are happy to answer you. . Specially having friends and colleagues you can rely on helps in avoiding pitfalls. . Googling the right way is also a key skill. . Reading Books . Some non-fiction books are made in a way where you can skip chapters liberally. Do so, close the book and live your life. . For other non-fiction books, you can do the same if you understand the topic enough. If you don’t, don’t skip because you’ll risk learning false information. . Being Multidisciplinary . Aspects from one discipline apply to other. Learn something random and you’ll find you apply the same principle in other field. . It see,s better to learn by categorizing. Like: A music instrument, a physical activity, a social activity, etc. . Mental Models and Heuristics. . These can help you find out more information about a topic faster by making good guesses. . Some of my favorite mental models are: . Inversion (Most Useful) | Occam’s razor | Map is not a territory | Confirmation Bias | Circle of Competence | Pareto Principle | . Make Time and Think . Thinking means you’ll question things from the first principles. To see if they are valid or not. . Then you scrutinize it.

            "content": ". Marketing . Marketing is about finding the right prospespects, keeping their attention and make them interested in what you have to offer. Every business needs to do it because no matter how good your product is, you won’t have profit until your customers can find you. . Direct-Marketing sometimes reduces the lines between itself and sales because it reduces amount of time to close the deal. . But overall, Marketing and Sales are completely different activities. Marketing is about keeping attention. Sales is about closing the deal. . The product that does not sell without advertising. Will not sell with advertising. . Attention . The number 1 rule of marketing is that attention is limited and every other company is trying to grab attention. . People are only interested in things they like and the things that are important to them. Therefore high quality attention is important. And high quality attention must be earned. . At the same time, the aim is not be popular. The aim is to increase profits. So if you can get yourself on TV, you’ll be popular but you’ll waste a lot of time not finding the right customer. . Receptivity . People ignore what they don’t care about. . Receptiveless is how open a person is to your message. There are three parts to this: message, timing and medium . Message: The person should be interested in the message you are offering. Timing: The person should recieve the message at the right time. Medium: The person should recieve message from the right medium. Example: A personlized message will likely be more effective than same commercial message to every person. . From a business perspective, you want your customers to be as receptive as possible. . Remarkability . Remarkability is being enough different to pique the interest of your customers. Being remarkable voiletes customer’s usual expectations and grabs their attention for free. . High remarkability generated word of mouth. Advertisement is what is done when you are not remarkable (or not remarkable enough). . Probable Purchaser . Assuming everyone will purchase your product is bad. There are only a set of people who would. So it makes no sense to try to appeal to everyone. . Appeal to the right customer at the right time. Every good marketing compain does this. . Preoccupation . Always assume that your prospect has preoccupied himself/herself with something. Your goal is to be interesting enough so that you can grab their attention. . The threshhold for this maybe low or high depending on your environment and type of product. . Level of Awareness . You need to be sensitive to how much your probable customer cares about your offer. . There are 5 levels to this: . Unaware | Problem Aware | Solution Aware: Knows solution but not aware of specific offer | Offer Aware | Full Aware | Your goal is to identiy the level the prospect is at the push them towards upper level -&gt; The Funnel. . The best way to do it is to personalize your message for each prospect and level. . End Result . Humans don’t always do what the think they are doing. Eg: People who buy SUV don’t use it for it’s purpose. They use it to feed their status. . Find out what they really desire and appeal to it. . Ankush: Combine this with Education Based Selling. You cannot sell loads of crap just because it makes someone feel high status. . Demonstration . Demonstration is one of the oldest tricks which significantly increases probability of sale. . Demonstrate your product to the customer. Make them use it. Let them see the results themself. This removes a lot of doubts the prospect may have. . Qualification . It is better to screen prospects and find the right customers that to have bad customers. This has to happen before sale. . Ideally your funnel should remove bad customer. Bad onces will consume un-neccesary time, attention and resources. . After that you can focus on better serving the right once. . The prospect who is not right for you may be right for your competitors. You don’t have to be jumpy about not serving bad prospects, help them by refer them to competitors. . Point of Market Entry . Point of market entry is the point at which the random prospect becomes interested in finding the solution to the problem. . Certain markets have obvious entry point and exit point. . Having the attention of the prospect during point of entry is valuable because the prospect will set you as a standard while comparing with your competitors. This increases your likelihood of sale. . Point of entry is the reason why organic and paid-ad search are so valuable. . Addressability . There are certain problems and types of prospects that open up in public. These can be sensitive issues. . So you’re not going to find a TV Ad style boadcast to do much of a trick or expect a viral word of mouth recommendation. . But you can position yourself in places where they are more liekly to find you. . For example for sensitive health issues, doctors are an easy medium to get to your prospect compared to TV ad. . Nowadays people also Google the solution to their problem, therefore targetted ads are also useful. . Addressability is how easy it is to get in touch with your prospects. Ideally you wannt high addressibility. . If you choose an already addressable market, you’ll reduce your efforts significantly. . Desire . Desire is one of the part of marketing that get’s people off. If someone does not desire your product, no one will purchase it. . Scammy marketters are people who promise a product which is different for what they deliver. But it is almost impossible to sell someone something that they don’t desire. . Your goal is not to appeal to people who don’t desire, it is to find people who can convince themself of how your offer will benifit them. . The more core human drives your marketting offer connects to the more effective it will be. . Visualization . When your work speaks for itself, don’t interrupt. . Test driving is one of the most effective tactics. The prospects stop rationlizing, the emotional part of their brain takes in and they start wanting. Once that is done, it is only a matter of time before sale is made. . Our minds are designed to visulize the consiquences of our actions. By making it easy (by putting as much sensory info as possible) for your prospects to visulize how purchasing the product solves the problem and makes them feel, they will conclude with “I want this”. . Framing . Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. . Framing a natural form of communication. There is always some sort of compression when we tell the image. Therefore it pays attention to be concious about it. . Framing your communication to be persuasive and exact can get the point accross faster while honoring the listener. . Framing is not same as deciet, you are not lying. . While framing make sure that the listener know what they need to know because if not done it will harm your reputation. . Free . Getting attention is not the same as getting paid. . Offering free value is a quick way to attract potential customers. But the free value should be such that additional sales negate the amount of resources spent of free. . Done well, this will lead to sales you wouldn’t otherwise have made. . Permission . No one likes spam. So it is better to ask for people’s permission to send them more information in case of newletters, phonecalls, etc. . Do not abuse your privilage. if you keep you keep providing real value in those newsletters, etc. you’ll find more people interested in your paid offering and will create a deeper relationship with the prospect. . Before asking for permission, make it clear what they’ll be getting and how it will benifit them. . This is the next best thing since it reduces marketing cost and increase likelyhood of prospect purchase overtime. . Hook . The smaller your message, the less likely people are to forget it. . Hook is a small enough message that keeps people’s attention and conways to them what you are offereing and who you are. It also makes it easy for people to tell about you to their firends. . Examples: . A million songs in your pocket -&gt; IPod | 4 hour work week | . Hook can be title, subtitle, slowgan etc. Use it in as many places as possble. . Generate a lot of hooks and test which onces work. . The hook grabs attention and the remainder of your marketing sales activities close the deal. . Call To Action (CTA) . Your prospects won’t know what to do next, so tell them and make it obvious for them. CTA should be simple, single and obvious. . Best CTA ask for either sale or permission to follow up. . Ensure that every message you create has a clear CTA. . Narrative . A common format of a narrative is “Hero’s Journey”. The hero recieves call of adventure and overcomes obstacles to achieve his goals. . The customer wants to be a hero. Knowing that others are already walked on the path makes it easy for them to follow the path themself. . Therefore testomonials, case studies and other stories make it easy for customer to choose your call to adventure. . Controversy . If your position is to agree with everyone else, then you’ll become boring. . Controvery means taking a stand for something you care about even if people disagree with it. Controversy promote discussion and attract peopl’e attention. . Not all controversty is good. As logn as you are able to maintain a sense of bigger picture of how you’re trying to help, a bit of controvery can create useful awareness. . Reputation . Like it or not, the market’s perception becomes your perception. . Branding often means increasing and maintaining reputation. . People are willing to pay to premium for a good reputation. . Reputation is not under direct control you can only try to improve it overtime. It includes everything: products, advertisement, customer service, etc. . Building reputation takes time and effort but is one of the most important marketing out there. .",

Entrepreneurs find a problem, solve it, and earn money as a reward. . In capitalism terms, money is proof that you are adding value to the world. 1 .

It is efficient to adapt ourselves to the world than to do the opposite. Money is a form of trust. . You’re going to need money to have the effect of any kind and at any stage. Being a capitalist (employee or entrepreneur), providing value, and being compensated with cash is the best way to do it. . Capitalism + Ethics . Capitalism is not perfect. If not kept in check, it can turn evil (Example: East India Company) and provide no value. . Ethics is not intrinsic to capitalism. And it probably never be as it is hard to map out. A combination of the two leads to more results than one or the other. . Ethics enables you to play long-term games, be trustworthy and win social trust. . The mix of the two is probably why companies like Apple and Tata Group are so successful and trusted for so long. They provide high value while not compromising on ethics. .

Most OSS are libraries for developers to use. . Some exceptions are Signal, VLC and Chrome. . Why companies make their project open source? . Recognition . Companies, especially smaller ones, gain a lot of recognition by being developing open-source software. An example of this is BaseCamp which built Ruby on Rails. . Market Capture . Enterprises and even smaller companies prefer free open source software over the paid ones if it gets their work done faster. . Hiring . Open-source software help companies find and recruit good talent. Though it is likely not the main reason for making open-source software. . Revenue . Most companies don’t depend on their open-source software for profit. . The once which do usually rely on: . Donations | Provide additional proprietary features at Premium. Like: Cloud Support. | Problems with open source . Not all OS projects are equal. Some projects are better maintained than others. . Sustainability . The revenue does not seem sustainable. The companies which only focus on open source products either require a lot of Donation (like Ubuntu) or have to pivot heavily to be sustainable (like RedHat recently) . Deception and Priorities . OSS often doesn’t openly admit to having bugs. If a developer knows of bugs in the OSS they can choose not to use the product. But usually, developers get to realize the bugs themself after a few months of using the products. . Critical bugs may be ignored as open-source projects have their own set of priorities. Sometimes the prioritize the number of issues fixed over addressing critical once. There is low/no accountability 1 since it is free. . Paid products provide priority support for paid customers, thus resolving issues faster. . When choosing an open-source project, check GitHub issues first. 1 . Also, open-source projects do get abandoned which does not happen with paid products. . Flutter EXPOSED: Extreme JANKY animations. “A nightmare framework” &#8617; &#8617;2 . |",

Ethics extends from personal to even business decisions (like data privacy). . Ethics . Ethics is hard to define. Objectively, it is a myth, a shared myth 1. . For the sake of this post, let’s reduce ethics to: . Not doing wrong things that you know are wrong. | . Not being corrupt . One should be ethical so that once’s mind isn’t corrupt when facing life’s challenges 2. . So that once can act sane and not make things worse. . Reducing decision fatigue . A side effect of being ethical is that you’ll have fewer decisions to make. You can instantly eliminate un-ethical once. . The price you pay not being ethical . Your habits and actions are proofs to yourself of the kind of person you are. 3 . If you take the same behaviour and stretch it to a lifetime, you will likely be in a very different place to where you are. . The direction of things is more important than the speed at which you achieve them because you could end up in a very different place. . Long Term Greedy 4 . Being ethical is being greedy long term. . The hallmark of any compounding process is short term pain for long term reward. . For example: If people know you are ethical, they trust you more. They’ll be more likely to do deals through you. 4 . Example 2: If you are ethical, you are surrounded by ethical people. 4 . Being ethical includes a lot of short term pain for a future reward. . Having nothing to hide. 4 2 . Being ethical allows you to tell the truth almost always and not be afraid of the consequences. . Node in a network . Your actions and decisions are more than yours. They are a ripple in a network 2. . If you can affect 1000 people positively, they might do that same to other people. Positive things branch out like a tree. . Meaning . Ethics provide life more meaning. . A meaningful life is more exciting and fulfilling. . Rights and Responsibilities . Rights and responsibilties is how you create trust and have a fare trade. .

This summary may spoil your reading experience if you have not read the book yourself. . The order of points is random. . The book . The book is a brief history. It transitions fast and beautifully from one topic to another. . It also presents arguments and counter-arguments in a way that tries to explain the whole thing from maximum points of view. This kind of writing and thinking is something I aspire. . Lessons . Cousins . We had a lot of cousin humans. Once upon a time, Around six species of humans roamed the earth at the once. | We are not unique. 3 billion years ago our universe was born. It will stay for billions. We are not even the human species that has survived the longest (as of yet). | There are countless species. We are just specie that got lucky thanks to our intellect and imagined realities. | Imagined Realities . History is random. There are cause and effect to certain events but there is no reason why history could not have turned in some other way. | Religion is a recent thing. (10,000 years ago). | The way we interact and work together with stranger and form groups larger than 150 is by imaging things. | Societal constructs like nation, company, ethics, etc are imagined realities shared by billions. It’s so strong that we act according to them in the real world. | There is no justice in history. Even a human right is an imagined construct. There is nothing in biology that suggest it to be a truth. These constructs do help keep people sane. | Destroyer of Species . Huntergathers were healthier than us but they did not live for that long. | There is no going back once the Agriculture Revolution started. Why would someone want to go back to hunting? | We are Thanos for other species. Our species has captured and killed and effected almost all animals on earth. | We don’t look at animals with the same view as we look at other humans. We abolished human slavery but are okay with animal slavery. | Capitalism . Science is largely a product of Capitalism and politics. | Capitalism allowed us to progress fast. | Capitalist if not checked can do anything for money. Slave trading companies were listed in the London Stock Exchange. This seems kind of similar to current privacy breaching companies or how we farm animals. | The stock investor would not care what happens in the company. he is just interacted in making a return. | Government and legal checks are necessary to keep Capitalists in check. | Accepting Ignorance . The scientific revolution was a result of Europeans accepting that they are ignorant. That they don’t know things. | The reason the Scientific revolution took place in Europe instead of India or China (even if Asia controlled 80% of world GDP) is because of social constructs. | Asians did not accept their ignorance and did not venture out to find answers to things they did not know. | New material discovered increase progress rapidly. | Unification . The 3 things that brought humankind together; Empired, Religion, Money. | Money crossed lines which religion could not. Everybody loves money. | There have been many types of money and does not include just a coin. | We are all influenced by European culture. No country has an original culture. It’s a mix. | Math . Maths allowed us to predict the future. | Time and timetable tracking is recent. Though it is very efficient. | Buddhism . Western liberals mix their view with the Buddhist view. | The Buddhist view is not that the happiness in individual and it must be protected. | The main part is the internal states are fleeting and they change every moment. There is no point in chasing after it. | Credit . Banks and the whole financial system are built on credit. They provide more money than they have hoped for a future return. This is a large contributor to human progress. . Lone Individual . Individual needs are now satisfied by state and organizations instead of family and community. . If you want money, you can take a loan. | if you want an education you go to school. | if you are unemployed there are un-employment schemes. | if you are old, there are retirement schemes. | . Transendance . Humans have transcended genetic boundaries. . We learn faster and adapt quicker. Unlike other animals whose genes dictate what they do. | We have created medicines and technologies that far exceed and extend our natural limitations. | . Communication . A band of good communication sapiens of 500 could beat Neanderthals with a pack of 5 times more. | Gossip is natural to us. Gossip conveys important information like who to avoid, what to do, what not to do, etc which helps us be safe. | Peace in our time . Humans have been safer than ever. And we seem to be moving towards more peace. | Compared to history, the decolonization of colonies has been relatively peaceful. Everyone seems to be tired of war. | Nature . Biology is always changing. It is never constant or fixed. If you go by this line of thinking, more than human 2 genders are possible and biology won’t have any problem with it. .",

I would argue that if the discovery you made or a solution you made even is it already exist and you didn’t know about it is still an act of research. You may even find some improvements. . The act of research does not have to be big. . Ready-made solutions - Globalisation . Globalisation has allowed us to take fruits of someone else’s research. . As of 2020, China and the USA dominate technology. We Indians (and many from other countries) are more of a witness to this domination. . There are also different issues to solve. The social issues in India and different than those in developed nations. And therefore globalisation has a faster positive impact compared to research activities. .

Earlier, I was avoiding the cloud because it seemed very hard. But like every computer science buzzword, it is much much easier than expected. . Recently I started learning AWS. These are a few things that have changed my mind. . Cost: Pay only for what you use . Cloud is anyway cheaper than building and maintaining your server. . The cost can be optimized further by setting up things properly. . Cost is impacted by decisions such as: . Pay per minute | Different cost for different configuration | Pay per GB of data stored | . And cloud vendors themselves provide options and encourage customers to optimize their usage to reduce cost. . Rapid Availability . Resources are available to you the instant you want them and in the location, you want them at. . If I were to start a Deep Learning project, on my local machine, it would take a full workday to just set things upright. Plus, you’ll have to deal with upgrades and maintenance yourself. . The same thing I wanted to do on AWS, it took just 3 minutes. . Special Hardware . In fields like Machine Learning, you need high computation and specialized hardware. . A cloud provider can provide it instantly. . Similarly, Quantum Programming is a new field for programmers that were not available to most developers. But cloud providers are providing infrastructure for this new field. . Choice: “We’ll provide infrastructure. Your code!” . Traditionally, if you buy hardware and it is not used, you cannot do much other than selling the hardware to reclaim the cost. . Cloud solves this problem by allowing users to change their underlying infrastructure at any moment. . Maintainance: “We’ll provide support. You code!” . Small things like replication of the servers and databases, scaling, sharding, maintaining security, etc are automatically taken care of with a few clicks. . Cloud vendors provide a good set of defaults and out of the box solutions to these common problems. . Abstraction: Easier than Traditional Setup . Cloud vendors make it easier to use the cloud. Things are abstracted and one can choose to learn until what is required. . Most normal developers would not have to deal with specifics of the infrastructure. . Special APIs: Code less . Almost all cloud providers provide special APIs for things like text recognition, image recognition, and even blockchains. . One need not be an expert to use these out of the box solutions. . Conclusion: Cloud is a Win-Win . Cloud provides a lot of consumer surplus. . Cloud is such that the price of owning and maintaining for the individual user than if they would have built a server themselves. . While for the cloud provider, it is also cheap because they provide it at scale. . Not to mentions, they are easier to use and provide the flexibility of choice. .",

Reading is also an antidote to shortened attention span. . If you can really read, then you can read way faster than you can listen or watch. . Habit . Keeping distractions away while reading helps. . To start, read anything. Even a page better than no page. . Reading slowly is okay. You may finish the book in 3 months. Not a big deal. . Medium . Reading on a phone 2 is great if you can manage to keep distraction beyond. . Reading physical books is ideal. 3 . You can listen to an audiobook as a last resort but it likely won’t be fulfilling and you won’t remember details. 1 . New words . If you don’t know a word in the book, learn it right there and there. If you don’t you are just approximating what the author says. . If you are going to read a series of 📚 then learn each new word. The same word will be used later. . Selecting books to read . Reading from different categories is an easy way to broaden your perspective. . Always be reading at least 2 books, fiction, and non-fiction. . Non-fiction: Makes you more informed and puts things into action. | Fiction: Makes you less boring and counteracts the overthinking created by non-fiction. | . Don’t buy non-fiction books that have just been released. Let the reviews come in. . If the right book is selected, it is worth paying the price. . Reading foundational books like History of something or mathematics rather than diving into the latest trends allows you to broaden your understanding and remember faster 31. . Speed Reading . Reading speed increases naturally as you get into a habit of reading regularly. . Your reading speed is higher when you read a topic you are familiar with. It is slower when you read something new. . Therefore if you are speed reading, it is probably not worth reading that book. 1 . There is nothing wrong with reading slow. Big abstract concepts require time 3. . Reasoning . Don’t agree with everything you read. Authors are humans too. 4 . Put yourself in the shoes of the author and try to reason through his conclusions. . You want to internalize the author’s thinking/mindset so that you can see the problem from his point of view. 1 . Reading books that provide a counter-argument to your thought or to a book you have read is also interesting. . If you don’t understand a certain section or a concept, google/youtube it and clear it. . Memorize . Book notes make it easy to non-only reason but to memorize the gist of the book. . Don’t copy-paste. Write in your own words. It should be your thoughts. | . The narrative makes it easy to remember. Some non-fiction books have a narrative too. . You can choose to read fiction instead of non-fiction for the same topic. . Get interested in big picture first. Get interested about the author. You’ll be interested about the book. .

A few changes happened between 2013 to 2020 (now) that seem to have effected this notion. . Competition and Similar Content . The amount of people uploading and watching “content” has exploded. . If a few years ago the same content would have less competition. But now not just the content has to compete with other similar content but also over factors like freshness. . Reducing attention span . Personalized Recommendation Engines . Bigger companies saw value in the shift in attention towards online sources and exploding data. . Since the amount of data has increased, the recommendation algorithms designed to keep people engage and make advertisers happy are getting more and choosy. . Personalized Search Engines . A few years go personalize results only appeared for feeds, now appear in normal search results too. This means that everyone who searches for something gets different results. . But this also means that you are more likely to target your specific demographic as the algorithm thinks it is the right fit. . These all lead to change in SEO strategy . The basic search engine optimization (SEO) methods like keyword optimization and backlinking no longer work as well as effectively as they used to. These methods were more or less automatic and easy for people to make their websites reach people easily. . The newer methods which work along with are basic SEO strategies are more analog.

Site-specific strategies like Thumbnail and Timestamp on Youtube, | Creating a ‘brand’ account and promoting | Engaging and trying to retain users with witty and regular posts/stories | . Conclusion . The newer methods of engagement are more work than what they were a few years ago. . At the same time, the result of these efforts is more shorten as the same strategy is applied by every other content generator. .

Programming role for the most part is to configure other’s code/modules/APIs so that it works well along with other modules and our tiny code. . And whatever tiny code that we do write is rarely even unique. For the most part, it is either the same functionality as something built before or copy/pasted from StackOverflow or Github. .

I wanted to contribute to PyTorch so I read their code and understood nothing. . I thought I had enough Python &amp; DL skills but that was not the problem. . The point was they have ATEN: a kind of configuration language that allows them to generate programs in their target language on the Fly. .

Learning a principle such as Deep Learning means that underlying technological tools such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, or even AutoML matter very little. .

Accuracy should always be calculated on the validation set. . Creating a separate validation set . val_len = int(len(ds)*0.01) # 0.01 percent of data train_len = len(ds) — val_len # all other are in training from torch.utils.data import random_split train_ds, val_ds = random_split(ds, [train_len, val_len]) . Likewise, 2 data loaders are created. . bs = 64 train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, bs) val_dl = DataLoader(val_ds, bs) . Changes in the training loop . A separate list called accuracies in created to store the accuracy of an epoch. . ... with torch.no_grad(): accuracy = 0 for images, labels in val_dl: out = net(images.float()) accuracy+=(out.argmax(dim=1) == labels).sum().item() accuracies.append(accuracy/len(val_ds) * 100) . Graph . Since the accuracy of each epoch was stored in a separate accuracies list, creating a graph was easy. . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot(range(epochs), accuracies) . Data Normalization . After plotting the graph, I realized accuracy was 43% which is the same as the score of commit 2. . The easiest thing to do was to normalize the data. . Since MNIST images are in the range of 1…250 the easiest thing to do was to divide by 250 which would result in a range of 0…1. . Ideally, the range should be around 0 so an even better approach would be . image = image/250–0.5 . this would result in a range between -0.5…+0.5. . Later we would use torchvision.transforms.Normalize(mean, std, inplace=False) which generates unique normalization value for each dataset . Commit 6: ConvNet, and GPU . Day 6 . | Score — 0.97 . | Time invested — about 2 hours (lots of googling and reading docs) + 1 hours fixes bugs . | . ConvNet . Convolutional Neural Networks are ideal images. . ResNet . ResNet 34 is my goto ConvNet but since MNIST is so easy, I went with ResNet 18. . import torchvision.models as models resnet18 = models.resnet18(pretrained=True) resnet18.fc #print fully connected network . ResNet is designed to output 1000 classes. But our output is from 0…9 aka 10 classes. . lin_in = resnet18.fc.in_features import torch.nn as nn resnet18.fc = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(lin_in, 10), nn.Softmax(dim=1) ) . Convert Grayscale to RGB image . ResNet expects RGB images. MNIST is grayscale. . img = img.view(3, 28, 28).expand(3, 28, 28)` . This grayscale to the RGB line is added to our Dataset class. . Normalization . When using an existing model, we need to use the same normalization values as that model. The docs mention the normalization value. . import torchvision.transforms as transforms normalize = transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) . The init and getitem dataset class have been modified to use this transformation. . Modifications have also been made to test_ds. . GPU . One I started the training loop, I realized it suddenly became too slow. . GPU is needed! . device = torch.device(&#39;cuda:0&#39;) if torch.cuda.is_available() else &#39;cpu&#39; . If the GPU is on, the device will be cuda. . The neural network and the data in training, validation and texting loop have been changed to run on GPU. . net = net.to(device) ... images, labels = images.to(device,dtype=torch.float), labels.to(device) . And since we are on GPU we can increase our batch size from 64 to much higher. . I experimented with a few sizes from 320…640 and kept an eye on GPU utilization and settled for 512. . .

Along with monitoring GPU and CPU usage, I modified training_loop to show the amount of time taken to complete each epoch. . bs = 512 num_workers = 2 train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, bs, num_workers=num_workers) val_dl = DataLoader(val_ds, bs, num_workers=num_workers) .

The above guide mentions some things that are worth mentioning here: . Some applications will be easier to upgrade than others, and there are many ways to make it easier for yourself. It is possible to prepare and align AngularJS applications with Angular even before beginning the upgrade process. These preparation steps are all about making the code more decoupled, more maintainable, and better aligned with modern development tools.

While you are reading your nested block, you have to remember what all conditions preceded it. . The below guideline should counter that: . Max indent should be 2, in case of exceptions 3 . Avoid the use of else. . Return/throw when not okay . By returning early you make sure that in each of your functions the last line of your function returns what it is actually supposed to return. This will make your code consistent. . | Also, you would find that you avoid unnecessary nesting (which will calm your eyes 👁 and your linter). Thus, making your code easy to understand. . | . . Bubble vs Gateway . Bad (left): Bubble-Style . Good (right): Gateway-Style . If deep nests exist? Separate loop and operation . Extract the logic to other readable methods or use streams (Java)/lambda or something equivalent in your programming language of choice. . Usually, there is a problem where you have to perform a bunch of operations on an array of objects. . I tend to create at-least** 2 functions** for this: . One that performs an operation on a single object. . | Other calls the first function in a loop. . | In case if something goes wrong, it is easier to debug it since I know what function has what responsibility. . Simplified Example: Link to Code . . You have a bunch of students for which you calculate the average grade. . . In the above BadGrader, you can see than the code of calculating the grades is within the loop. This is bad as we cannot use the same piece of code elsewhere in the program. . . The BetterGrader separates the calculation part from the printing part. . . GoodGrader removes the naive logic that was used to calculate average and replaces it with a much shorter code that makes use of inbuilt functions. . This is an example of chunking which will be explained more in the next post. . Next: Leave clues (Naming convention) . Index: Tips on writing Clean Code . Resource: .

Some ideas I found while experimenting on my own. . . Usually building a software looks like this . You start small. But by the time you reach halfway, it becomes chaotic. . . Reading vs Writing Code . While coding we spend more time reading the existing code than writing the code. We can estimate the ratio to be something like 10:1. . Most of the time you are more likely to modify and improve your code than to produce a new functionality. . . For something we spend the most time on, it is very important that we make the process of reading and understanding our code easier for ourselves and other developers. . Why do we write bad code? . Work needed to be done fast . | Tired of project/work . | Requirement changed . | Managers . | WE — Developers . | Work, for now, will clean up later .

Kaggle is a platform for data science where you can find competitions, datasets, and other’s solutions. . | Some Kaggle datasets cannot be downloaded directly and can only be downloaded through Kaggle via it’s CLI. . | The Setup (One-time activity) . 1 — Install Kaggle CLI . To get started to Kaggle CLI you will need Python, open terminal and write . $ pip install kaggle . 2 — API credentials . Once you have Kaggle installed, type kaggle to check it is installed and you will get an output similar to this . . In the above line, you will see the path (highlighted) of where to put your kaggle.json file. . To get kaggle.json file go to: . https://www.kaggle.com/&lt;username&gt;/account . In the API section, click Create New API Token. And copy it the path mentioned in the terminal output. . . Type kaggle once again to check. . . In my case, even after copying it was not working. I had the file in place but it did not have the right permissions so I had to type the exact command they gave me. And it started working. . Downloading Dataset via CLI . You can open kaggle help via . kaggle -h . For getting info on competitions you can type . kaggle competitions download -h . whatever the Kaggle CLI command is, add -h to get help. . Find Data . while you can explore Competitions, Datasets, and kernels via Kaggle, here I am going to only focus on downloading of datasets. . What I do is I explore competitions or datasets via Kaggle website. . Download Entire Dataset . To download the dataset, go to Data *subtab. *In API section you will find the exact command that you can copy to the terminal to download the entire dataset. . . . The syntax is like . kaggle competitions download &lt;competition name&gt; . Download Particular File From Dataset . As you can see, the size of the data is 34 GB which is huge. . So instead of downloading entire dataset, you can select which files to download. . You cannot provide download multiple files with a single command (as of 2019/Aug/10) so you will have to download it one by one using the following command. . kaggle competitions download -f &lt;file-name&gt; &lt;competition-name&gt; . .

The contest was a month ago from this writing. I had the time to really sit and figure out what went well and what didn’t. . Approach . Here was my approach which I did in stages: . Step 1: Make models . 1. Make a simple resnet50 model. And make sure input and output submission file are correct. . 2. Improve the model. I found that the images were black and old. But the number of images were less and we cannot use external data so my solution was. . Heavy data augmentation (warping, crops, rotations): lead to 5–7 percent increase in F1 score and accuracy. . | Progressive increase image size. . | I initially started with (50,70) images . | Trained it that then increased it. Trained it again. . | . 3. Training approach. . Freeze the model train for 4 epochs | Unfreeze the model train for 7 epochs | I found unfreezing was getting higher accuracy but only when done more than freeze training. 7 is what I stuck at. | I replicated the kernel and trained resnet18, resnet34, vgg16, vgg19 and densenet121 so that I can ensemble there outputs | Model Making Environment: Kaggle Code at Models directory | . Step 2: Max Ensemble . After I had all the outputs from different models. . I used the output CSVs to make a max ensemble. .

Code: ankschoubey/AnalyticsVidya_Game_Of_Deep_Learning . Lessons and Mistakes Learned . Code . Environment . I trained on Kaggle Kernel. The only way to get output files was to commit. . | I also did not load existing models because on Kaggle you have to attach it as a dataset and then load. It’s a pain so I did not bother. . | It would have been much easier to train on Google Cloud, Collab or Clouderizer. . | . Should have used discriminative learning rate. . Transfer learning without discriminative learning rate is stupid. | . Refactor code early before replicating the kernel . I replicated kernels so that I can train different models on different kernels and get results faster. . | The problem was that I had introduced a bug which got replicated. Also, making changes was a pain because I had to copy paste things multiple times. . | . Use metrics used in the contest . Kind of dumb to mention this: I did not use the F1 score. Rather relied on accuracy. . Save as many things as I can so that you save time later . Save results . | Save model . | Save data . | . Use Checkpoints . Did forget the idea of checkpoints entirely. | . Useless Model . I made an ensemble which sucked because it only lead to 0.05 percent improvement. . | The reason was I used a lot of mediocre models. . | 1 ResNet 34/50 would have been fine. . | Also did not know about DenseNet very well back then. . | I believe that an ensemble of ResNet and DenseNet would have been wonderful. . | . Data . Look at the data and use good augmentation . I saw some images were grey scale and old. I might have got a higher score if I had taken time | . . Using good data augmentation. . My model was not performing well. 93–94% accuracy was the limit. . I buffed up every transformation. And it started reaching 96+. Warping helped a lot. . . Developer Habits .
